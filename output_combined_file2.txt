When did I ever refuse an accommodation All of you know me here When did I ever refuse except one time And why Because I believe this drug business is going to destroy us in the years to come I mean it's not like gambling or liquor or even women which is something that most people want nowadays and is forbidden to them by the pezzonovante of the church Even the police departments that have helped us in the past with gambling and other things are gonna refuse to help us when it comes to narcotics", 157: "sceneStart7719 sceneEnd7815 sceneId157 and I believe that now Times have changed It's not like the old days when we could do anything we want A refusal is not the act of a friend If Don Corleone had all the judges and the politicians in New York then he must share them or let others use them He must let us draw the water from the well Certainly he can present a bill for such services After all we are not Communists I also don't believe in drugs For years I paid my people extra so they wouldn't do that kind of business Somebody comes to them and says I have powders If you put up a three four thousand dollar investment we can make 50000 distributing So they can't resist I want to control it as a business to keep it respectable I don't want it near schools I don't want it sold to children That's an infamia In my city we would keep the traffic in the dark people the colored They're animals anyway so let them lose their souls I hoped that we could come here and reason together And as a reasonable man I'm willing to do whatever's necessary to find a peaceful solution to these problems Then we are agreed", 158: "sceneStart7815 sceneEnd7953 sceneId158 And Don Corleone will give our protection in the east and there will be the peace But I must have strict assurance from Corleone As time goes by and his position becomes stronger will he attempt any individual vendetta Look we are all reasonable men here We don't have to give assurances as if we were lawyers You talk about vengeance Is vengeance gonna bring your son back to you Or my boy to me I forego the vengeance of my son But I have selfish reasons My youngest son was forced to leave this country because of this Sollozzo business All right And I have to make arrangements to bring him back here safely cleared of all these false charges But I'm a superstitious man And if some unlucky accident should befall him if he should get shot in the head by a police officer or if he should hang himself in his jail cell of if he's struck by a bolt of lightening then I'm going to blame some of the people in this room And that I do not forgive But that aside let me say that I swear on the souls of my grandchildren that I will not be the one to break the peace we've made here today When I meet with the

at all Of course my father told me she gave lousy head but that's beside the point Well at least you blame yourself for your sexual inadequacies No I blame them Chicks never help you out They never tell you what to do right And most of them are all selfconscious about the smell factor And so most of the time they just lay there frozen like a deer in headlights I mean not for nothin' but when a chick goes down on me I let her know where to go and what the status is You gotta handle it like CNN and the Weather Channel Constant updates You are such an idiot No no he's got a point I mean that's how I was in high school You know all nervous and inhibited about being eaten out But by the time I got to college that all changed I've loosened up I was like one of those guys at the airport with those big flashlights wavin' 'em this way directin' 'em that way tellin' 'em when to stop And that's all I'm sayin' It would be different if chicks helped out You know pointed a guy in the right

that kind of thing up close and personal before It just took a while to process You wanna talk about it If you want to I like you Holden I haven't liked a man in a long time And it's not because I'm a manhater or something like that It's just been some time since I've been exposed to a man that didn't immediately live into a stereotype of some sort And I want you to feel comfortable with me because I'd really like us to be friends So if there's anything you wanna know it's okay to ask me  Okay  Okay Okay Why girls  Why men  Well because that's the standard If that's the only reason you're attracted to women No it's more than that So you've never been curious about men Curious Well I always wondered why my father watched Hee Haw but  You know what I mean  No  Why not  No interest  Because  Girls feel right Well that's how I feel You know I've never really been attracted to men  Well so you're still a virgin then  No But you've only been with girls So you're saying a person is a virgin until they've had intercourse with a member of the opposite sex Isn't that the standard definition Again with your standards I think virginity is lost when you make love for the first time  With a member of the opposite sex  Why Why only then Because that's the standard What do you want me to tell ya So if a virgin is raped then she's still a virgin  No of course not  But rape is not the standard So she's had sex but not the standard idea of sex Hence according to your definition she'd still be a virgin  Okay fine I'll revise  Uhhuh Virginity is lost when the hymen is broken  Then I lost my virginity at ten  Really 'Cause see I fell on a fence post when I was ten and it broke my hymen Okay Second revision Virginity is lost through penetration Physical penetration or emotional  Emotional penetration  Mmm I fell in love hard with Caitlin Bree when we were in high school Physical penetration  We had sex  Yeah but not real sex I move to have that remark stricken from the record on account of it makes you come off as completely naive and infantile Well where's the penetration in lesbian sex I A finger I've had my finger up my ass I wouldn't say I've had anal sex Observe

society life tried to instill in me from day one The way the world is how seldom it is that you meet that one person who just gets you It's so rare My parents didn't really have it There were no examples set for me in the world of malefemale relationships And to cut oneself off from finding that person to immediately halve your options by eliminating the possibility of finding that one person within your own gender that just seemed stupid to me So I didn't But then you came along You the one least likely I mean you were a guy Still am And while I was falling for you I put a ceiling on that because you were a guy Until I remembered why I opened the door to women in the first place To not limit the likelihood of finding that one person who'd complement me so completely So here we are I was thorough when I looked for you And I feel justified lying in your arms 'cause I got here on my own terms and I have no question there was someplace I didn't look For me that makes all the

a real problem with this Alyssa thing I think it's more like Banky's having a real problem with all things not hetero and I'm just another paradigm of said aberration  Banky does not hate gays  But he is a bit homophobic This latest episode between you and Miss Thing has tapped into that In his warped perception he lost you to the dark side which is she You make it sound like me and him were dating Don't kid yourself That boy loves you in a way that he ain't ready to deal with  He's been digging up dirt on Alyssa  Uhuh honey And just what has Mr Angela Lansbury uncovered about your lady fair He heard some bullshit story that she took on two guys Really Then he's barkin' up the wrong tree if he wants to split you up isn't he He's not gonna make you see the error of your ways by pointing out how truly gay she's not  This one  I have it  Actually it has kinda gotten to me  How so Well Banky's got a pretty good bullshit detector  He's not known for misinformation  So what if it is true  Would that bother you  Sex with multiple partners At the same time Ah Ooh Thanks for being so comforting I appreciate it So what do you care That's just it you know I shouldn't care  But it just It

this fool picture of lipstick lesbians in their heads like they all resemble Alyssa while most of 'em look more like you Do I detect a little intersubculture cattiness here Gay or straight ugly's still ugly And most of those boys are scary I thought you fags were all supersupportive of one another Screw that allforone shit I gotta deal with bein' a minority in the minority of the minority and nobody's supportin' my ass While the whole of society's fawning over girlsongirls here I sit a reviled gay man And to top that off I'm a gay black man notoriously the most swishy of the bunch  Three

Look at what I have to resort to for professional respect What is it about gay men that terrifies the rest of the world  As for this hangup with Alyssa's past  Umhm maybe what's troubling you is that your fragile fantasy might not be true  What does that mean  Holden don't even try to come off like you don't know what I'm sayin' Men need to believe that they're Marcofuckin'Polo when it comes to

bullshit and let them labor under the delusion that they're rockin' my world until I can't stand 'em no more then I hit 'em with the truth It's a sick game The world would be a better place if people

took a 26yearold guy to my senior prom and left to have sex with him and Gwen Turner in the back of a limo How about in college when I let Shannon Hamilton videotape us having sex only to find out he

Some sex Yes Holden That's all it was some sex Most of it stupid high school sex Like you never had sex in high school There is a world of fucking difference between typical high school sex and getting fucked by two fuckin' guys at the same time  They fuckin' used you  No I used them You don't think I would have let it happen if I hadn't wanted to do you I was an experimental girl for

time Give me a fuckin' headache I went through somethin' like what you're talkin' about a couple years ago  This chick named Amy  When A couple of years ago What she live in Canada or something Why don't I remember this Bitch what you don't know about me I could just about squeeze in the GrandfuckingCanyon Did you know I always wanted to be a dancer in Vegas Huh Bet you didn't even know that

in and I ask about the exboyfriend which as we all know is a really dumb move You don't want to know but you just have to know Stupid guy bullshit So anyway she starts tellin' me about him They fell in love went out for a couple of years lived together Her mother likes me better blah blah blah blah And I'm okay But then she drops the bomb on me and the bomb is this It seems that a couple of times while they were goin' out he brought some people to bed with them Menageatrois I believe it's called Now this just blows my mind right I'm not used to this sort of thing  I was raised Catholic for God's sakes  Saint Shithead Do somethin' So I'm totally weirded out by this right And I just start blastin' her I don't know how to deal with what I'm feelin' so I figure the best way is if call her slut right and tell her she was used I'm out for blood I really want to hurt this girl What the fuck is your problem And she's just calmly trying to tell me It was that time that place and she doesn't think she should apologize because she doesn't feel that she's done anything wrong I'm like Oh really I look her in the eye and tell her it's over I walk Fuckin' A No idiot It was a mistake I wasn't disgusted with her I was afraid You know at that moment I felt small like I'd lacked experience like I'd never be on her level never be enough for her or something like that But what I did not get she didn't care She wasn't lookin' for that guy anymore she was lookin' for me for the Bob But by the time I figured this all out it's too late man She moved on All I had to show for it was foolish pride which then gave way to regret She was the girl I know that now But I pushed her away So I've spent every day since then chasing Amy So to speak Enough of this fuckin' melodrama My advice Forget her

wondering why I asked you here at the same time knowing that we have shit to settle between us separately I just figured you wanted to kill two birds with one stone You know by telling her to fuck off with me here so you wouldn't have to go through the story again later on  Fuck you  Not even if you let me videotape it Okay enough All right Enough Now I've been going over and over and over this whole thing and I've dissected it a thousand different ways Banky there's tension between you and I for the first time in our lives You hate me dating Alyssa and you want me to sign off on this cartoon thing How perceptive Alyssa you and I have hit a wall 'cause I don't know how to deal with your uh your past I guess That's a nice way of putting it I'd have said the whole double stuff thing I'm only gonna tell you this once Shut up Now I know I'm to blame one way or another on both accounts Alyssa with you because I feel inadequate because you've had such a big life and so much experience and my life's been pretty small in comparison  That doesn't matter to me  Please I have to get through this okay Banky I know why you're having such a hard time with me and Alyssa It's something that's been obvious forever and I guess I guess I just didn't acknowledge it You're in love with me What You're attracted to me Just as in a way I guess I'm attracted to you It makes sense We've been together so long we have so much in common Well I gotta get goin' I gotta catch the last few minutes of Little House It's somethin' you're gonna have to deal with Bank And that would explain your jealousy of Alyssa your homophobia your sense of humor Jesus just 'cause a guy's got a predilection toward dick jokes Bank Stop Deal with it You'll feel much better Okay Now you guys are probably asking yourselves the same question that I've been going over and over in my head the past few weeks What does one have to do with the other Don't And when I did some serious soulsearching it came to me from outta nowhere And it all made sense And a calm came over me I know what we have to do And then you Banky you Alyssa and I all of us can finally be all right Please don't say it We've all gotta have sex together", 63: "sceneStart5820 sceneEnd5883 sceneId63 I mean look don't you see That would take care of everything Alyssa with you I won't feel too inadequate or conservative anymore because I'll have done something on a par with all your experience And it will be with you which will make it that much more powerful Banky you can take that leap that everyone else but you sees you should take And it'll be with me your best friend for years We've been everything to each other but intimates and now we'll have been through that together too And it won't be a total leap for you because a woman will be involved And when it's over all that hostility you feel toward Alyssa will be gone because you'll have shared in something beautiful with the woman I love It'll be cathartic This will keep us together", 64: "sceneStart5883 sceneEnd6203 sceneId64 What do ya say Sure You know I need this You know it'll help No Thank Christ Sorry No I thought you'd be into this You

Can't you see that I mean how can you not No What does that say about me You can take it from two guys whose names you can hardly remember but I ask you to share an experience about intimacy and you say no  I can't  Baby yes you can I'll be there And when it's over we'll be the strongest we've ever been 'cause we'll have been through this together Then we'll be on the same level and there'll be

you forget about the things you're hung up on  It'll create more  No I've thought about all that Yes it will Maybe you'll see me differently from then on Maybe you'll despise me for going along with it once you're in the moment Maybe I'll moan differently and then you'll resent Banky and become suspicious of us Or you'll alienate him because of it You'll grow to blame and hate me for the deterioration of your friendship Or what if and God I sincerely doubt it but what if I saw something in Banky that I've never seen before you know and I fell in love with him and left you I've been down roads like this before Many times I know you feel doing this will broaden your horizons and give you experience But I've had those experiences on my own And I can't accompany you on yours I'm past that now Or maybe I just love you too much And I feel hurt and let down that you would want to share me with anyone Because I would never want to share you Regardless I can't be a part of this Or
