1
0:01:43.48 --> 0:01:46.24
My grandfather, King George

2
0:01:46.28 --> 0:01:48.53
he take'em me walkabout...

3
0:01:48.58 --> 0:01:51.71
teach me blackfella way.

4
0:01:51.75 --> 0:01:56.46
Grandfather teach'em me most important lesson of all.

5
0:01:57.66 --> 0:01:59.67
Tell'em story.

6
0:02:02.40 --> 0:02:05.70
That day I down the billabong.

7
0:02:05.74 --> 0:02:09.96
King George teach me how to catch'em fish using magic song.

8
0:02:12.81 --> 0:02:16.87
See, I not blackfella. I not white fella either.

9
0:02:16.91 --> 0:02:19.43
Them white fellas call me mixed-blood...

10
0:02:20.92 --> 0:02:23.24
- half caste. - Yea!

11
0:02:23.29 --> 0:02:25.78
Creamy.

12
0:02:25.82 --> 0:02:28.79
- Hyah! - I belong no one.

13
0:02:28.82 --> 0:02:31.88
That day I see'em them white fellas.

14
0:02:31.93 --> 0:02:34.65
They were pushing them cheeky bulls across the river...

15
0:02:34.70 --> 0:02:37.63
onto Carney land.

16
0:02:41.94 --> 0:02:45.74
King George angry at them white fellas.

17
0:02:47.21 --> 0:02:51.80
King George say them white fella bad spirit.

18
0:02:51.85 --> 0:02:54.50
Must be taken from this land.

19
0:03:04.40 --> 0:03:14.40
FarangSiam thanks you. Have Fun!

20
0:03:20.48 --> 0:03:22.15
Shh.

21
0:04:13.20 --> 0:04:15.21
Coppers.

22
0:04:15.26 --> 0:04:17.08
Them coppers come take me away.

23
0:04:17.13 --> 0:04:20.06
They want to put me on that Mission Island.

24
0:04:21.60 --> 0:04:24.76
Make me into a white fella.

25
0:04:27.28 --> 0:04:29.83
But they're not coppers.

26
0:04:31.15 --> 0:04:33.70
Whoa there. Whoa. Whoa.

27
0:04:36.79 --> 0:04:40.28
And that first time I saw her

28
0:04:40.32 --> 0:04:42.33
that Mrs. Boss.

29
0:04:42.39 --> 0:04:46.35
The strangest woman I ever seen.

30
0:04:46.40 --> 0:04:48.68
She's not from this land.

31
0:04:52.70 --> 0:04:56.93
This land my people got many names for...

32
0:04:56.97 --> 0:04:58.98
but white fellas call it...

33
0:05:00.74 --> 0:05:02.75
Australia.

34
0:05:05.28 --> 0:05:07.67
But this story not begin that day.

35
0:05:07.72 --> 0:05:13.10
This story begin a little while ago in a land far, far away.

36
0:05:13.16 --> 0:05:16.38
That land called England.

37
0:05:22.20 --> 0:05:25.25
My husband must sell Faraway Downs.

38
0:05:25.30 --> 0:05:28.74
But the offer from this "Cattle King," Mr. Carney...

39
0:05:28.77 --> 0:05:31.13
is only one sixth of what it was once worth.

40
0:05:31.17 --> 0:05:33.13
We need the money, Ramsden.

41
0:05:33.18 --> 0:05:35.73
But Maitland is just about to muster the fats.

42
0:05:35.78 --> 0:05:37.09
What?

43
0:05:37.15 --> 0:05:39.13
Get the big cows ready for market.

44
0:05:39.18 --> 0:05:41.13
Ramsden, you and I both know...

45
0:05:41.18 --> 0:05:45.38
there is only one reason my husband has spent so much time down under...

46
0:05:45.42 --> 0:05:48.08
and it has absolutely nothing to do with cows.

47
0:05:48.12 --> 0:05:51.02
At least not of the animal variety.

48
0:05:51.06 --> 0:05:53.28
Lady Ashley, I do think that's a bit harsh.

49
0:05:53.33 --> 0:05:56.42
- Oh, Ramsden, drink your tea. - Lady Ashley!

50
0:05:56.47 --> 0:05:59.33
What do you intend to do?

51
0:05:59.37 --> 0:06:01.59
I intend to travel to this cattle station...

52
0:06:01.64 --> 0:06:03.35
sell it...

53
0:06:03.41 --> 0:06:05.96
and bring Maitland home myself!

54
0:06:06.01 --> 0:06:09.53
But, Lady Ashley, it's Australia.

55
0:06:09.81 --> 0:06:13.51
Darling Sarah, I implore you, do not travel.

56
0:06:13.55 --> 0:06:15.63
Outbreak of war imminent. Stop.

57
0:06:15.68 --> 0:06:19.52
Maitland, your concern regarding war duly noted. Stop.

58
0:06:19.56 --> 0:06:21.54
Have plan concerning cattle.

59
0:06:21.59 --> 0:06:24.05
Sale to King Carney not necessary.

60
0:06:24.09 --> 0:06:27.62
- Need more time. Stop. - Nonsense. Stop.

61
0:06:27.66 --> 0:06:32.06
Expect contract for sale of station to be drawn by time of my arrival. Stop.

62
0:06:32.10 --> 0:06:35.30
Cannot meet you. Stop. Am mustering. Stop.

63
0:06:35.34 --> 0:06:38.74
Have sent trusted man. Stop. The Drover. Stop.

64
0:06:40.44 --> 0:06:42.45
The Drover?

65
0:06:52.72 --> 0:06:56.56
Drover, you boong (Aborigine or Black) lover.

66
0:07:01.23 --> 0:07:03.52
Any of you other Carney boys want to have a go?

67
0:07:08.30 --> 0:07:12.44
Come on, fellas. Don't let fear stand in your way.

68
0:07:13.54 --> 0:07:14.92
I'll have ya.

69
0:07:16.41 --> 0:07:19.27
Hey! No boongs in here!

70
0:07:19.32 --> 0:07:22.72
He's not in the pub, Ivan.

71
0:07:24.59 --> 0:07:27.52
Go on.

72
0:07:27.56 --> 0:07:32.02
Run after your boong friend, 'cause as far as this town's concerned, you are a black.

73
0:07:32.06 --> 0:07:34.52
You work with them, you eat with them...

74
0:07:34.56 --> 0:07:36.52
and you sleep with them.

75
0:07:36.57 --> 0:07:38.55
Oh, crikey.

76
0:07:44.81 --> 0:07:46.55
When you see her, wave your hat.

77
0:07:54.45 --> 0:07:56.84
What are you waiting for, an invitation?

78
0:07:58.32 --> 0:08:00.33
I hate coming to town.

79
0:08:03.36 --> 0:08:06.05
Lady Sarah Ashley.

80
0:08:06.10 --> 0:08:09.96
A genuine aristocrat living right here in Darwin.

81
0:08:10.00 --> 0:08:11.78
Administrator, we're at war.

82
0:08:11.83 --> 0:08:13.32
Oh.

83
0:08:13.37 --> 0:08:15.25
As the officer...

84
0:08:15.30 --> 0:08:17.99
in charge of livestock purchases for the armed forces.

85
0:08:18.04 --> 0:08:21.23
- She's quite a looker. - I fail to see...

86
0:08:21.28 --> 0:08:24.17
what Lady Sarah Ashley...

87
0:08:24.21 --> 0:08:28.28
has to do with Carney's stranglehold of the beef industry.

88
0:08:28.32 --> 0:08:30.64
Her husband, Lord Ashley...

89
0:08:30.69 --> 0:08:33.81
claims he's mustering fats at Faraway Downs.

90
0:08:33.86 --> 0:08:35.84
- Faraway Downs? - Faraway Downs.

91
0:08:35.89 --> 0:08:38.95
The only cattle station in the whole of the north...

92
0:08:38.99 --> 0:08:42.62
not owned by Leslie "King" Carney.

93
0:08:42.66 --> 0:08:45.47
Lord Maitland Ashley is mustering on Faraway Downs?

94
0:08:45.50 --> 0:08:46.77
Yeah, yeah.

95
0:08:46.84 --> 0:08:50.47
- Isn't quite what we had in mind, is it, Neil? - No. Yeah.

96
0:08:50.51 --> 0:08:53.13
And now his missus has arrived on the flying boat.

97
0:08:53.18 --> 0:08:57.04
Doesn't look like they're gonna sell Faraway Downs to me, Neil.

98
0:08:57.08 --> 0:08:59.03
Ah, she won't last.

99
0:08:59.08 --> 0:09:03.04
A delicate English rose withers in the outback. Hmm.

100
0:09:03.09 --> 0:09:04.43
You with me?

101
0:09:04.49 --> 0:09:06.84
If you must know, I am to be met

102
0:09:06.89 --> 0:09:09.98
by my husband's trusted man, a Mr. Drover.

103
0:09:10.03 --> 0:09:11.47
The bloody Drover?

104
0:09:14.83 --> 0:09:17.48
Bring it. Yes.

105
0:09:17.53 --> 0:09:20.05
Move it.

106
0:09:20.09 --> 0:09:24.32
Look at my wife and daughter down there giving her the royal welcome.

107
0:09:24.36 --> 0:09:27.69
My fiancÃ©, Neil Fletcher, manages Faraway Downs.

108
0:09:28.87 --> 0:09:30.88
Good day.

109
0:09:32.57 --> 0:09:35.12
A bit pale.

110
0:09:35.17 --> 0:09:38.30
Not a bad-looking sheila, but what's the story on the luggage?

111
0:09:38.34 --> 0:09:41.20
Wants to settle down in the outback, does she?

112
0:09:41.25 --> 0:09:46.20
If she stays and Lord Ashley manages to get his cattle down onto that wharf there...

113
0:09:46.25 --> 0:09:49.51
then we've got a competitor for the army contract, Neil.

114
0:09:49.55 --> 0:09:53.75
Carney's control of every cattle station in the north...

115
0:09:53.79 --> 0:09:57.72
jeopardizes the supply of beef to our troops.

116
0:09:57.75 --> 0:10:01.48
But it's a poor war that doesn't make a decent patriot rich, so...

117
0:10:01.52 --> 0:10:04.92
I don't want a single beast from Faraway Downs...

118
0:10:04.96 --> 0:10:08.48
to set a hoof on that wharf.

119
0:10:10.26 --> 0:10:15.18
- You with me, Neil? - Yeah, yeah. Nature will take its course.

120
0:10:19.21 --> 0:10:20.88
What about the missus?

121
0:10:20.94 --> 0:10:23.91
No, I've arranged for someone special to give her the old scenic route.

122
0:10:26.48 --> 0:10:28.19
Give her a taste of the outback.

123
0:10:28.25 --> 0:10:30.33
No!

124
0:10:32.59 --> 0:10:35.17
- Who's taking her? - The Drover.

125
0:10:39.66 --> 0:10:41.61
The Drover?

126
0:10:41.66 --> 0:10:45.64
Enjoy the ride, sweetheart.

127
0:10:51.77 --> 0:10:54.09
I'm Sarah Ashley.

128
0:10:57.64 --> 0:10:59.63
My husband, Lord Ashley...

129
0:10:59.68 --> 0:11:02.07
has sent a trusted man to collect me.

130
0:11:02.12 --> 0:11:03.56
A, huh. A Mr. Drover.

131
0:11:05.52 --> 0:11:08.58
It seems as if he has been waylaid.

132
0:11:10.59 --> 0:11:12.30
No women.

133
0:11:12.36 --> 0:11:13.90
Ladies' lounge next door.

134
0:11:13.96 --> 0:11:17.45
The hen parlor's that away, my dear.

135
0:11:17.50 --> 0:11:19.48
No wonder your establishment is empty.

136
0:11:22.37 --> 0:11:24.48
Good day.

137
0:11:27.37 --> 0:11:29.66
Oh! Oh!

138
0:11:30.98 --> 0:11:32.90
You can take him!

139
0:11:37.22 --> 0:11:39.40
No!

140
0:11:59.54 --> 0:12:01.53
Oh! No, no!

141
0:12:01.58 --> 0:12:04.70
No, not my bags. Not my.

142
0:12:04.74 --> 0:12:07.77
Oh, no, no!

143
0:12:13.83 --> 0:12:16.42
Here.

144
0:12:16.47 --> 0:12:18.42
Welcome to Australia.

145
0:12:22.51 --> 0:12:25.00
Drover take Mrs. Boss to Faraway Downs...

146
0:12:25.04 --> 0:12:27.36
in a great, big, fancy truck.

147
0:12:28.41 --> 0:12:31.68
He even let her sit in his special seat.

148
0:12:31.72 --> 0:12:35.71
She even drinks Drover's own water bottle.

149
0:12:35.75 --> 0:12:36.96
That's it.

150
0:12:37.02 --> 0:12:39.68
They get along like a burnin' house.

151
0:12:39.72 --> 0:12:41.74
Now, Magarri he sit'em up top.

152
0:12:41.79 --> 0:12:44.81
And Magarri's cousin Goolajbaloong

153
0:12:44.86 --> 0:12:46.85
he come along for the ride.

154
0:12:46.90 --> 0:12:49.39
- Oh! - They make'em friends right away.

155
0:12:49.43 --> 0:12:51.04
Water.

156
0:12:51.10 --> 0:12:52.31
Oh.

157
0:12:52.37 --> 0:12:55.27
That's it. That's it. Stay, Jedda. Stay.

158
0:12:59.74 --> 0:13:02.50
"Trusted man." Typical of my husband.

159
0:13:02.55 --> 0:13:04.50
Actually, your husband's a pretty good bloke.

160
0:13:04.55 --> 0:13:06.87
Yes, well, he certainly knows how to choose his employees.

161
0:13:06.92 --> 0:13:09.94
- Employee? - Mmm. No wonder the place is bankrupt.

162
0:13:09.99 --> 0:13:12.03
- Lady, I'm not an employee. - Really?

163
0:13:12.09 --> 0:13:15.11
So you're just driving me all the way out to Faraway Downs...

164
0:13:15.16 --> 0:13:17.34
- as a personal favor to my husband, are you? - No.

165
0:13:17.40 --> 0:13:19.51
Him being such a good bloke and all, hmm?

166
0:13:19.56 --> 0:13:22.89
I'm driving you out there because he promised me a drove of 1,500 head of cattle.

167
0:13:22.93 --> 0:13:25.01
- What, to buy? - No, you goose. To drove.

168
0:13:25.07 --> 0:13:28.29
I'm a drover, right? I move the cattle from "A" to "B."

169
0:13:28.34 --> 0:13:31.81
All right? I work on commission. No man hires me, no man fires me.

170
0:13:31.84 --> 0:13:33.26
- Oh. - Everything I own...

171
0:13:33.31 --> 0:13:36.21
I can fit in my saddlebag, which is the way I like it.

172
0:13:36.25 --> 0:13:41.07
Oh! Yes, well, it's all all very "outback adventure," isn't it?

173
0:13:41.12 --> 0:13:43.37
- I'm not saying it's for everyone. - No.

174
0:13:43.42 --> 0:13:45.71
Definitely not for everyone.

175
0:13:45.76 --> 0:13:48.72
Most people like to own things. You know, land, luggage, other people.

176
0:13:48.76 --> 0:13:52.72
Makes them feel secure. But all that can be taken away.

177
0:13:52.76 --> 0:13:56.23
And in the end, the only thing you really own is, huh,

178
0:13:56.27 --> 0:13:58.42
is your story.

179
0:13:58.47 --> 0:14:00.48
Just tryin' to live a good one.

180
0:14:00.54 --> 0:14:04.03
Yes, yes. An adventure story. Mmm. You sound just like my husband.

181
0:14:06.34 --> 0:14:08.96
Oh!

182
0:14:09.01 --> 0:14:11.27
Oh, they're kangaroos!

183
0:14:11.32 --> 0:14:13.57
- Big reds. - Oh! Lovely.

184
0:14:13.62 --> 0:14:16.01
- Beautiful. - Oh, yeah, yeah. Beautiful.

185
0:14:16.05 --> 0:14:18.10
I've never seen a kangaroo. Beautiful, jumping.

186
0:14:18.16 --> 0:14:20.17
- Yeah, they're jumping. - Oh!

187
0:14:20.22 --> 0:14:22.74
Oh, it's beautiful.

188
0:14:22.79 --> 0:14:26.16
- Huh - Oh! Look at them jumping!

189
0:14:36.57 --> 0:14:39.37
Ah!

190
0:15:10.37 --> 0:15:12.99
Mr. Drover.

191
0:15:13.04 --> 0:15:14.65
Hey, Miss Boss.

192
0:15:14.71 --> 0:15:16.16
Tucker, Mrs. Boss?

193
0:15:16.21 --> 0:15:18.53
- Mr. Drover. - Yeah?

194
0:15:18.58 --> 0:15:21.01
- There's only one tent. - That's right.

195
0:15:21.05 --> 0:15:24.24
For the four of us? Well, you know, it gets pretty chilly here at night.

196
0:15:24.29 --> 0:15:27.69
We, huh... We like to bunk up together, eh, Magarri? Goolaj, huh?

197
0:15:27.73 --> 0:15:30.05
Nice and close, you know.

198
0:15:35.63 --> 0:15:36.64
Oh!

199
0:15:36.70 --> 0:15:38.71
Oh, come on, Lady Ashley.

200
0:15:38.77 --> 0:15:40.85
We're just having a laugh.

201
0:15:40.91 --> 0:15:44.93
Never really slept in a tent in our life. We just bunk around the fire, you see?

202
0:15:44.98 --> 0:15:48.03
- See, we're not really used to, hum... - A woman?

203
0:15:48.08 --> 0:15:51.34
I suppose you think I should be back in Darwin at the church fete...

204
0:15:51.38 --> 0:15:53.56
or the ladies'. Huh, whatever you call it.

205
0:15:53.62 --> 0:15:56.24
Well, I will have you know that I am as capable as any man.

206
0:15:59.59 --> 0:16:02.75
Guests. We're not used to guests. That's what I was about to say.

207
0:16:02.79 --> 0:16:05.92
But now you mention it, I happen to quite like the women of the outback.

208
0:16:05.96 --> 0:16:08.72
But they're mostly native women.

209
0:16:08.77 --> 0:16:10.27
Aboriginal women.

210
0:16:10.33 --> 0:16:13.46
They're very easy to, huh

211
0:16:13.50 --> 0:16:15.96
to get along with, if you try.

212
0:16:16.01 --> 0:16:18.63
âª Whoa, babe something is bothering me âª

213
0:16:18.91 --> 0:16:21.97
Go!

214
0:16:22.01 --> 0:16:24.19
- Ho! - Him always punctual.

215
0:16:27.99 --> 0:16:31.25
Get out of here!

216
0:16:31.29 --> 0:16:34.18
- What's that? - Your accountant.

217
0:16:34.23 --> 0:16:38.15
Hey, Drover! He's your bloody problem now!

218
0:16:38.20 --> 0:16:40.21
See you, Drover!

219
0:16:44.67 --> 0:16:47.79
Kippelly Flymm.

220
0:16:47.84 --> 0:16:51.27
- Kippelly Flynn. - I'm sorry. What was your name again?

221
0:16:51.31 --> 0:16:55.50
Lipelling Klymm, Milady.

222
0:16:55.55 --> 0:16:57.63
Kipling Flynn.

223
0:16:58.65 --> 0:17:00.66
Thanks.

224
0:17:05.82 --> 0:17:08.68
How long till we reach Faraway Downs?

225
0:17:08.73 --> 0:17:11.69
Oh, we've been on it for the last two days.

226
0:17:15.13 --> 0:17:17.75
- Drover! Hey, Drover! - Yeah, love. How you doing?

227
0:17:17.80 --> 0:17:20.23
Good. Aren't you gonna stop and have a rest for a while?

228
0:17:20.27 --> 0:17:22.76
Nah, gotta make a delivery. Put the kettle on.

229
0:17:22.81 --> 0:17:25.80
- I'll be round in a couple days. Give us a kiss. - Okay.

230
0:17:25.84 --> 0:17:28.39
See you soon.

231
0:17:28.45 --> 0:17:30.83
- She's easy to get on with. - Ah, she's trouble, that one.

232
0:17:30.88 --> 0:17:32.83
- See you later! - Bye!

233
0:17:32.88 --> 0:17:35.85
You and my husband share an interest.

234
0:17:35.89 --> 0:17:37.53
An interest? Really?

235
0:17:37.59 --> 0:17:41.35
Come on. We all know the real reason that my husband is out here.

236
0:17:41.39 --> 0:17:44.36
Oh. Right. You mean the breeding. Yeah.

237
0:17:44.40 --> 0:17:46.72
- Breeding? - Yeah.

238
0:17:46.76 --> 0:17:48.88
No, we're both dead keen on breeding.

239
0:17:48.93 --> 0:17:50.89
I have this idea, which, huh, which he loves.

240
0:17:50.94 --> 0:17:53.55
You might be quite excited about it too, actually.

241
0:17:53.60 --> 0:17:57.37
Now, I'm a brumby man, but his fancy English filly, Capricornia...

242
0:17:57.41 --> 0:17:59.15
has really caught my eye.

243
0:17:59.21 --> 0:18:01.79
I got to admit. She is gorgeous. Really gorgeous.

244
0:18:01.85 --> 0:18:05.14
Gorgeous creature.

245
0:18:08.55 --> 0:18:11.55
I've always wanted to mate an English thoroughbred with a bush brumby.

246
0:18:11.59 --> 0:18:15.55
I mean, it'd be magic, wouldn't it? Magic.

247
0:18:15.59 --> 0:18:17.67
- Imagine that combination. - Don't. Don't you say another word.

248
0:18:17.73 --> 0:18:20.55
- I know what you're implying. - You've thought about it, too, haven't you?

249
0:18:20.60 --> 0:18:22.75
Capricornia. You Poppycock!

250
0:18:22.80 --> 0:18:24.58
- What are you talking about? - Poppycock!

251
0:18:35.55 --> 0:18:37.50
Coppers.

252
0:18:37.55 --> 0:18:41.18
- What are you talking about? - You want.

253
0:18:43.29 --> 0:18:47.25
- You want to have it on with me. - What? What was that?

254
0:18:47.29 --> 0:18:49.24
Oh, you know exactly what I'm saying.

255
0:18:49.29 --> 0:18:51.44
Just like you have it on with that poor girl you're exploiting...

256
0:18:51.50 --> 0:18:53.68
and, and, and God knows how many others.

257
0:18:53.73 --> 0:18:55.11
What are you talking about?

258
0:18:59.74 --> 0:19:01.62
- You got a filthy mind, lady. - You're an animal!

259
0:19:01.67 --> 0:19:04.73
I wouldn't have it on with you if you were the only tart left in Australia.

260
0:19:04.78 --> 0:19:06.56
- You are an animal! - Believe me, I wouldn't.

261
0:19:06.61 --> 0:19:08.06
You.

262
0:19:12.62 --> 0:19:14.12
Oh!

263
0:19:16.25 --> 0:19:17.60
Oh!

264
0:19:17.65 --> 0:19:18.93
What was that?

265
0:19:18.99 --> 0:19:21.17
- Stay in the car. - No, no.

266
0:19:21.23 --> 0:19:24.05
Get your hands off me.

267
0:19:25.76 --> 0:19:28.15
For once in your life, do as you're bloody told.

268
0:19:44.68 --> 0:19:47.61
There she is.

269
0:19:48.89 --> 0:19:51.88
Faraway Downs.

270
0:20:02.23 --> 0:20:05.72
And that first time I saw her

271
0:20:05.77 --> 0:20:08.53
- that Mrs. Boss. - Oh! Oh!

272
0:20:23.82 --> 0:20:26.95
Lady Ashley, wait! Don't go in there!

273
0:21:02.16 --> 0:21:04.20
I'm so sorry.

274
0:21:24.18 --> 0:21:26.64
My family has had the honor of serving...

275
0:21:26.68 --> 0:21:30.45
the owners of Faraway Downs for three generations.

276
0:21:30.49 --> 0:21:33.07
We know how hard this land can be.

277
0:21:33.12 --> 0:21:36.02
But Lord Maitland Ashleyhe

278
0:21:36.06 --> 0:21:38.01
he never gave up.

279
0:21:38.06 --> 0:21:41.76
The only thing that could stop this decent and courageous man was a spear...

280
0:21:41.80 --> 0:21:45.80
from a murderous black, the so called King George.

281
0:21:45.84 --> 0:21:48.73
And he will be brought to justice.

282
0:21:48.77 --> 0:21:52.04
Let us now pray for Maitland Ashley...

283
0:21:52.08 --> 0:21:55.71
that his soul may enter peacefully through the gates of heaven.

284
0:22:04.92 --> 0:22:08.62
Lady Ashley, we can leave for Darwin first thing in the morning.

285
0:22:08.66 --> 0:22:10.70
Yes, yes. Certainly, Mr. Fletcher.

286
0:22:10.76 --> 0:22:12.44
Watch the, hum...

287
0:22:14.36 --> 0:22:17.70
I can't understand what my husband would have seen out here.

288
0:22:20.07 --> 0:22:22.76
Yeah, this land has a strange power.

289
0:23:02.51 --> 0:23:06.64
That first night, when the sun go to sleep...

290
0:23:06.68 --> 0:23:11.21
King George tell me this land be healed.

291
0:23:11.26 --> 0:23:16.27
He tell'em me that woman that far, far away woman

292
0:23:16.33 --> 0:23:19.15
she be like the rain.

293
0:23:19.20 --> 0:23:23.32
I've been thinking I'm gonna sing her to me.

294
0:23:25.37 --> 0:23:28.53
Make the land sing.

295
0:24:10.11 --> 0:24:13.91
I let you see me now.

296
0:24:13.95 --> 0:24:16.03
Who are you?

297
0:24:16.09 --> 0:24:18.20
I Nullah.

298
0:24:18.26 --> 0:24:20.17
How did you get in here?

299
0:24:20.22 --> 0:24:23.12
I make myself invisible...

300
0:24:23.16 --> 0:24:25.34
with gulapa magic!

301
0:24:33.47 --> 0:24:36.33
What do you want?

302
0:24:36.37 --> 0:24:39.84
That balanda Fletcher been curse to this place.

303
0:24:41.08 --> 0:24:44.34
But you like Rainbow Serpent.

304
0:24:45.35 --> 0:24:47.64
You mien muk.

305
0:24:47.68 --> 0:24:51.72
You heal this land, so I sing you to me.

306
0:24:53.19 --> 0:24:56.05
Like I sing a fish to me.

307
0:25:07.17 --> 0:25:08.99
I sing, too...

308
0:25:10.04 --> 0:25:12.63
when Mama and Fletcher...

309
0:25:14.24 --> 0:25:16.26
make wrong side business.

310
0:25:16.31 --> 0:25:17.89
Wrong sided business?

311
0:25:17.95 --> 0:25:20.44
You know.

312
0:25:20.48 --> 0:25:22.44
Laying down and tickling.

313
0:25:22.49 --> 0:25:26.28
- Oh, my goodness. - Me and you secret.

314
0:25:26.32 --> 0:25:29.69
Oh, my goodness. Mr. Fletcher?

315
0:25:29.73 --> 0:25:32.08
I got to sing to Mama to warn her...

316
0:25:32.13 --> 0:25:34.17
that Lord Boss Ashley is coming down.

317
0:25:34.23 --> 0:25:36.52
Maitland? I

318
0:25:36.57 --> 0:25:39.08
I mean, Lord Ashley?

319
0:25:39.14 --> 0:25:41.59
Yeah. He plenty funny.

320
0:25:41.64 --> 0:25:46.30
So that's why I took him down the billabong, shown him all the big, fat, cheeky bulls.

321
0:25:46.34 --> 0:25:49.34
Come here. Look'em. Look.

322
0:25:49.38 --> 0:25:51.46
Get pushed across that river...

323
0:25:51.52 --> 0:25:53.47
over to Carney land.

324
0:25:53.52 --> 0:25:55.26
The bulls.

325
0:25:55.32 --> 0:25:57.54
"Billabong"?

326
0:25:57.59 --> 0:25:59.74
That's where Maitland was killed.

327
0:25:59.79 --> 0:26:02.01
But, Mrs. Boss, that spear was...

328
0:26:02.06 --> 0:26:03.94
Please don't.

329
0:26:03.99 --> 0:26:05.81
Don't make'em that policeman take away my boy.

330
0:26:07.23 --> 0:26:09.05
Them coppers. That bad Fletcher.

331
0:26:09.10 --> 0:26:13.00
He say you see me, you send me to the Mission Island.

332
0:26:13.04 --> 0:26:16.13
To that lock. Throw away bloody key.

333
0:26:17.37 --> 0:26:19.36
Please, missus! Quick!

334
0:26:19.41 --> 0:26:21.99
I make us invisible.

335
0:27:44.43 --> 0:27:47.92
- Mrs. Boss. - Oh! Oh. It's you.

336
0:27:47.96 --> 0:27:50.99
Last night, I show you.

337
0:27:51.03 --> 0:27:52.14
Hyah!

338
0:27:52.20 --> 0:27:54.66
Where?

339
0:27:56.37 --> 0:27:58.42
Yeah. She's a beautiful day, isn't she?

340
0:28:00.01 --> 0:28:01.76
How was your sleep? Restful?

341
0:28:01.81 --> 0:28:03.96
I wouldn't say so, no.

342
0:28:04.01 --> 0:28:06.60
Yeah, now, the boys are the boys are just finishing up.

343
0:28:06.65 --> 0:28:10.14
Gotta tell you, they're a pretty sorry mob of cattle. Seems hardly worth the effort.

344
0:28:10.19 --> 0:28:12.14
Ready to go, Lady Ashley?

345
0:28:13.02 --> 0:28:14.13
Billabong.

346
0:28:14.19 --> 0:28:16.07
Mr. Fletcher...

347
0:28:16.13 --> 0:28:18.95
tell me about the big, fat cows that cross the river...

348
0:28:19.00 --> 0:28:20.95
down at the "billabalong," or whatever you call it.

349
0:28:21.00 --> 0:28:23.69
Near the billabong? No, that's Carney property over there.

350
0:28:23.73 --> 0:28:25.24
Our cattle don't cross the river.

351
0:28:25.30 --> 0:28:27.66
- Apparently they do. - Yeah?

352
0:28:27.70 --> 0:28:29.24
Who says they do?

353
0:28:30.31 --> 0:28:32.32
That little boy there.

354
0:28:38.68 --> 0:28:42.38
Oh, you mean the little half caste fella?

355
0:28:42.42 --> 0:28:44.84
Hey. Hey, little fella. Come here.

356
0:28:44.89 --> 0:28:48.66
Come and tell Mr. Fletcher what you told me last night.

357
0:28:49.59 --> 0:28:51.60
Yeah, come on, Nullah.

358
0:28:52.93 --> 0:28:55.01
- Yes. - They're funny ones.

359
0:29:03.41 --> 0:29:05.52
Now...

360
0:29:05.58 --> 0:29:08.73
did you see big, fat cattle crossing Marmont River?

361
0:29:08.78 --> 0:29:13.32
Or were they just Carney cattle on the other side of the river having a drink?

362
0:29:15.69 --> 0:29:18.65
Them just Carney cattle, Mr. Fletcher.

363
0:29:18.69 --> 0:29:21.51
- I been lookin' myself. - Yeah?

364
0:29:26.13 --> 0:29:29.93
Ah, you tell great, big, tall stories, don't ya, eh?

365
0:29:29.97 --> 0:29:34.09
It's all right, Mr. Fletcher. I'm sure the boy just made a mistake.

366
0:29:34.14 --> 0:29:36.53
All right. We best get going, Lady Ashley.

367
0:29:36.57 --> 0:29:40.83
Sing Song. Take the little fella to the kitchen. Give him a big feed of that tucker he likes.

368
0:29:40.88 --> 0:29:43.88
- Forgive me, Mr. Fletcher. - Look. I understand.

369
0:29:43.91 --> 0:29:45.69
You barely slept.

370
0:29:45.75 --> 0:29:47.76
- Wait, wait. - Let me go.

371
0:29:49.75 --> 0:29:52.04
Yeah. Well, that old windmill hasn't turned in years.

372
0:29:52.09 --> 0:29:54.41
He's a sweet little boy. I don't think he meant any harm.

373
0:29:54.46 --> 0:29:57.51
Yeah, no, they're funny, little creamies. They're all a bit soft in the head, yeah.

374
0:29:57.56 --> 0:30:00.62
That's why the, huh, government sends them to the mission.

375
0:30:00.66 --> 0:30:03.56
They all tell bloody monstrous lies. Yeah. And the next one, quick.

376
0:30:03.60 --> 0:30:05.55
Come on. We haven't got all day.

377
0:30:05.60 --> 0:30:07.45
I no bloody liar!

378
0:30:08.81 --> 0:30:12.03
He liar! He say this not work!

379
0:30:24.69 --> 0:30:26.43
Fletcher liar!

380
0:30:27.46 --> 0:30:29.71
- No! Leave him alone! - Nullah!

381
0:30:29.76 --> 0:30:32.25
- Fletcher! - I curse you!

382
0:30:32.30 --> 0:30:35.16
Leave him alone! Leave him alone!

383
0:30:35.20 --> 0:30:38.67
- Please! - Run! Run! Run, Nullah! Run!

384
0:30:38.70 --> 0:30:40.95
I curse you!

385
0:30:41.00 --> 0:30:43.29
Leave him alone!

386
0:30:43.34 --> 0:30:46.27
Mr. Fletcher!

387
0:30:46.31 --> 0:30:49.13
- Leave him alone! - Mr. Fletcher!

388
0:30:53.18 --> 0:30:55.30
Get off my property.

389
0:30:55.35 --> 0:30:57.27
You no longer work for me.

390
0:30:57.32 --> 0:31:00.75
If I go, my men go with me.

391
0:31:00.79 --> 0:31:04.79
There won't be a single bloody beast in the stockyard to start the drove in the morning.

392
0:31:04.83 --> 0:31:07.92
You heard what I said. Get off my property!

393
0:31:07.96 --> 0:31:09.92
- Yeah? - Go!

394
0:31:09.97 --> 0:31:12.52
Now!

395
0:31:15.54 --> 0:31:17.76
You're the boss.

396
0:31:18.91 --> 0:31:20.86
Flynn, get in the car.

397
0:31:20.91 --> 0:31:22.86
I'll give you a new job somewhere else.

398
0:31:22.91 --> 0:31:24.99
Bunch'em up, grab the gear. Pack it up.

399
0:31:25.05 --> 0:31:27.37
I'll see you in Desperation Creek in a few days.

400
0:31:32.42 --> 0:31:35.08
Bloody old fool.

401
0:31:44.07 --> 0:31:46.82
Carney's gonna get this property.

402
0:31:46.87 --> 0:31:49.89
Been a pleasure working for ya. Real pleasure.

403
0:31:49.94 --> 0:31:51.69
Yeah.

404
0:32:17.40 --> 0:32:21.74
That strange woman she fire'em that Fletcher.

405
0:32:27.11 --> 0:32:29.33
He can't hurt Mama no more.

406
0:32:34.25 --> 0:32:39.64
From that day on, we call her... Mrs. Boss.

407
0:32:44.09 --> 0:32:47.18
Why would Fletcher block the water pump?

408
0:32:47.23 --> 0:32:49.65
I don't know. All crazy.

409
0:32:49.70 --> 0:32:52.63
- White fella, blackfella, all crazy. - Crazy.

410
0:33:03.61 --> 0:33:06.07
Mr. Flynn.

411
0:33:07.42 --> 0:33:10.28
- Milady. - Don't get up.

412
0:33:11.69 --> 0:33:14.11
The truth, Mr. Flynn.

413
0:33:18.29 --> 0:33:21.49
This, huh, ledger...

414
0:33:21.53 --> 0:33:26.62
which, um, Fletcher had me keep for the benefit of your husband...

415
0:33:26.67 --> 0:33:29.73
is a tale of decline and ruin...

416
0:33:29.77 --> 0:33:33.40
redolent of the great Gibbon.

417
0:33:33.44 --> 0:33:35.90
There is, however, another...

418
0:33:35.95 --> 0:33:38.27
kept for the benefit...

419
0:33:41.18 --> 0:33:45.68
in which is recorded all the unbranded...

420
0:33:45.72 --> 0:33:47.73
fat cattle...

421
0:33:52.16 --> 0:33:54.41
And the boy.

422
0:33:54.46 --> 0:33:57.99
He's Fletcher's son, isn't he?

423
0:33:58.03 --> 0:34:02.29
As with all things Fletcher, it's impossible to prove anything.

424
0:34:02.34 --> 0:34:04.96
Still, if Carney's good Christian wife...

425
0:34:05.01 --> 0:34:08.01
ever comes to the same conclusion as yourself...

426
0:34:08.04 --> 0:34:12.87
Fletcher's chances of marrying their daughter would be dashed.

427
0:34:12.92 --> 0:34:15.81
I'm going to the authorities, and I will be telling them.

428
0:34:15.85 --> 0:34:18.54
- Carney is the authority here. - Are you suggesting...

429
0:34:18.59 --> 0:34:22.68
I let him steal my cattle and buy my property for a fraction of what it's worth?

430
0:34:22.73 --> 0:34:27.80
I'm suggesting that you continue to do what your husband set out to do.

431
0:34:29.50 --> 0:34:30.88
Drove.

432
0:34:32.04 --> 0:34:34.96
Drove the cattle to Darwin.

433
0:34:38.84 --> 0:34:41.02
I need a drink.

434
0:34:41.08 --> 0:34:43.94
My lady, drove.

435
0:34:43.98 --> 0:34:47.07
Drove the cattle to Darwin, sell them to the army...

436
0:34:47.12 --> 0:34:49.04
and you'll break Carney's monopoly.

437
0:34:49.09 --> 0:34:51.91
Use the profits to put Faraway Downs back on its feet.

438
0:34:51.96 --> 0:34:54.03
You go back to London.

439
0:34:54.09 --> 0:34:56.20
You're sitting pretty for the rest of your life.

440
0:34:56.26 --> 0:34:58.25
That's what Maitland said he was doing.

441
0:34:58.29 --> 0:35:02.09
And there's no reason why you can't do the same.

442
0:35:11.11 --> 0:35:13.09
There is just one small problem.

443
0:35:14.58 --> 0:35:18.21
Having dismissed Fletcher, there's no one to muster the cattle.

444
0:35:28.83 --> 0:35:30.78
Hyah! Hyah!

445
0:35:33.10 --> 0:35:35.52
Flynn! Mrs. Boss!

446
0:35:35.57 --> 0:35:37.78
It's the Drover!

447
0:35:50.68 --> 0:35:53.58
Drover! Drover!

448
0:35:53.62 --> 0:35:55.63
Hyah!

449
0:36:04.49 --> 0:36:06.61
Hyah!

450
0:36:08.13 --> 0:36:10.92
Yeah, Drover! Yeah!

451
0:36:10.97 --> 0:36:12.98
Teach me how to break them brumbies!

452
0:36:14.64 --> 0:36:16.65
- See any boys in there? - No.

453
0:36:16.71 --> 0:36:18.82
Goolaj, go see if they're out in the top paddock.

454
0:36:18.88 --> 0:36:21.77
- Mr. Drover! - Just get the bloody brumbies in there.

455
0:36:21.81 --> 0:36:24.40
- I'll find out what the hell's going on. - Teach me to break them horses.

456
0:36:24.45 --> 0:36:26.60
- Fill the water trough, son. - I need to speak to you!

457
0:36:26.65 --> 0:36:29.27
Where the hell are all the bloody stockmen, eh?

458
0:36:29.32 --> 0:36:32.34
- That's what I need to speak to you about. - Where's Fletcher?

459
0:36:32.39 --> 0:36:36.09
- We disagreed, and I dismissed him. - Dismissed?

460
0:36:36.13 --> 0:36:38.81
- Yes. - Wa. Hang on. What about the cattle?

461
0:36:38.86 --> 0:36:40.87
Well, it beggars belief, but as he was leaving...

462
0:36:40.93 --> 0:36:44.60
he deliberately let the cows out of the, huh, I don't know whatever you call it...

463
0:36:44.63 --> 0:36:45.77
and they ran off!

464
0:36:45.84 --> 0:36:48.86
Damn! Do you realize, woman, what you've done?

465
0:36:48.91 --> 0:36:51.49
Mr. Drover, do not take that tone with me. Thank you very much!

466
0:36:51.54 --> 0:36:53.49
- Don't take that tone with you, huh? - No.

467
0:36:53.54 --> 0:36:55.53
I'm asking you, woman, do you know what you've done?

468
0:36:55.58 --> 0:36:58.84
I won't get another drove this late in the season. You've cost me my living.

469
0:36:58.88 --> 0:37:02.18
- Can't you just round them up? - Round them up, huh? Oh, round them up. Yeah!

470
0:37:02.22 --> 0:37:05.31
- Yes. You just go get them. - 1,500 head of cattle.

471
0:37:05.35 --> 0:37:08.65
Oh! Scattered over a million acres with just me and my two men.

472
0:37:08.69 --> 0:37:10.77
That's a great idea. Stupid cow.

473
0:37:10.83 --> 0:37:13.34
Mr. Drover, I was right to dismiss Mr. Fletcher...

474
0:37:13.40 --> 0:37:14.77
on moral grounds.

475
0:37:14.83 --> 0:37:16.18
Moral grounds?

476
0:37:16.23 --> 0:37:19.43
You're at that again, are ya? Let me guess.

477
0:37:19.47 --> 0:37:21.65
He wanted to, huh, exploit you, did he?

478
0:37:21.70 --> 0:37:23.45
- Fancy you, did he? - What?

479
0:37:23.51 --> 0:37:26.73
Stop it. I... Is there any man in this world who doesn't fancy you?

480
0:37:26.78 --> 0:37:28.56
- Please. - Huh?

481
0:37:28.61 --> 0:37:31.54
Mr. Fletcher is working for Mr. Carney.

482
0:37:31.58 --> 0:37:34.74
They were pushing the best of the unbranded cattle...

483
0:37:34.78 --> 0:37:39.70
across the river onto Mr. Carney's property.

484
0:37:39.76 --> 0:37:42.34
They were stealing!

485
0:37:44.59 --> 0:37:48.03
- There's no surprises there. - No, he's a bad man.

486
0:37:48.06 --> 0:37:50.93
All right, all right. But look. You can't prove it, right?

487
0:37:50.97 --> 0:37:53.05
- Well. - You can't.

488
0:37:53.10 --> 0:37:57.40
And you can't win against Carney. So just take my advice, lady.

489
0:37:57.44 --> 0:38:01.70
Grab King Carney's offer and go the hell back to England as quickly as possible.

490
0:38:01.74 --> 0:38:04.67
That way you'd make everybody happy, especially me.

491
0:38:08.62 --> 0:38:10.61
So you're just going to walk away?

492
0:38:10.65 --> 0:38:12.77
I learned a long time ago not to fight other people's wars.

493
0:38:12.82 --> 0:38:15.41
Wait! Wait! Wait! Mr. Drover, wait!

494
0:38:15.46 --> 0:38:18.39
Please, please, please! Mr. Drover, please! Please! Wait!

495
0:38:18.43 --> 0:38:21.01
Please. I...

496
0:38:21.06 --> 0:38:24.69
Listen. You said that your dream was to breed a thoroughbred with a...

497
0:38:24.73 --> 0:38:26.01
with a bush brumby.

498
0:38:26.07 --> 0:38:28.46
If you agree to help me,

499
0:38:29.77 --> 0:38:31.95
I will give you my Capricornia.

500
0:38:43.12 --> 0:38:46.65
And how we gonna do a drove with just me and my two men, huh?

501
0:38:50.76 --> 0:38:52.77
Oh, crikey.

502
0:38:52.83 --> 0:38:55.11
Mum was a drover's boy for Fletcher.

503
0:38:55.16 --> 0:38:57.89
Bandy was a drover's boy a long time ago.

504
0:38:57.93 --> 0:39:01.33
Some white stockmen like to have an Aboriginal woman on the drove...

505
0:39:01.37 --> 0:39:03.32
to keep 'em company at night.

506
0:39:03.37 --> 0:39:05.96
They shave their heads, make 'em look like boys...

507
0:39:06.01 --> 0:39:08.66
and work 'em like any other stockman during the day.

508
0:39:08.71 --> 0:39:10.66
That's, huh. What do you call it?

509
0:39:10.71 --> 0:39:13.57
- Exploiting them. - Exploiting, yes.

510
0:39:15.55 --> 0:39:17.50
Anyway, we're still in trouble.

511
0:39:17.55 --> 0:39:21.52
We gotta have seven good riders at least, and the most I can count is five.

512
0:39:21.56 --> 0:39:23.64
- What have we got? We've got me. - You.

513
0:39:23.69 --> 0:39:25.98
- Magarri. - Yeah, Magarri!

514
0:39:26.03 --> 0:39:27.48
- Goolaj. - Great.

515
0:39:27.53 --> 0:39:30.36
We got Daisy. Nice ride. And, huh, Bandy. Good work.

516
0:39:30.40 --> 0:39:33.12
Oh. What about Mr. Sing Song? Mr. Sing Song, ride horse?

517
0:39:33.17 --> 0:39:35.86
- Hey. Don't look at me. - Sing Song, me real good cooker.

518
0:39:35.91 --> 0:39:38.16
Cook's wagon at best. We got five, right? It's not enough.

519
0:39:38.21 --> 0:39:40.16
We need two more experienced riders.

520
0:39:40.21 --> 0:39:43.33
I did that run once back in 1935...

521
0:39:43.38 --> 0:39:45.38
with Magarri, Dingo Jones and the Drongo brothers.

522
0:39:45.40 --> 0:39:46.12
Drongo brothers.

523
0:39:46.18 --> 0:39:49.65
- True knights of the outback. - Mr. Flynn. Can you ride?

524
0:39:49.69 --> 0:39:51.53
- I can. - I won't carry a drunk.

525
0:39:51.59 --> 0:39:52.79
But don't.

526
0:39:52.86 --> 0:39:54.81
I ride'em real bloody good!

527
0:39:54.86 --> 0:39:58.38
I drove those no good cheeky bulls into the big, bloody metal ship.

528
0:39:58.43 --> 0:40:02.02
- All right. Five and a quarter. - Six and a quarter.

529
0:40:02.06 --> 0:40:03.78
What?

530
0:40:03.83 --> 0:40:06.38
Lady, this ain't trotting in Kensington Gardens.

531
0:40:06.44 --> 0:40:11.03
Mr. Drover, I could show you a thing or two about horses.

532
0:40:11.07 --> 0:40:14.54
Pretty sure, when it comes to horses, there's nothing you can show me.

533
0:40:14.58 --> 0:40:17.98
- Bring the horse. - You can't be serious.

534
0:40:18.01 --> 0:40:20.13
Bring the horse.

535
0:40:20.18 --> 0:40:22.19
Oh, this should be interesting.

536
0:40:23.89 --> 0:40:27.41
Move along! Move along! Rah! Rah!

537
0:40:27.46 --> 0:40:29.03
Move along!

538
0:40:29.09 --> 0:40:30.91
Rah! Rah!

539
0:40:30.96 --> 0:40:33.21
- What are you doing? - Shoo! Shoo!

540
0:40:33.26 --> 0:40:36.35
Rah, rah! Rah. Rah! Move it!

541
0:40:36.40 --> 0:40:39.19
- Lady Ashley. - Move it! Move it! They're going the wrong way.

542
0:40:39.24 --> 0:40:41.19
Rah! Rah!

543
0:40:41.24 --> 0:40:43.75
Rah! Rah!

544
0:40:43.81 --> 0:40:47.44
Oh! It's easy. Stubborn things. Silly cows.

545
0:40:47.48 --> 0:40:50.34
- Hey, hey, hey. What the bloody hell you doing? - Come on.

546
0:40:50.38 --> 0:40:53.57
You're scattering them all over the place. Get up the back there, up the tail.

547
0:40:55.89 --> 0:40:59.58
Get up there. Go, go, go, go, go! Don't let 'em break away.

548
0:40:59.62 --> 0:41:02.01
Go on.

549
0:41:05.39 --> 0:41:09.27
Run, you cows! Move, you cows!

550
0:41:10.80 --> 0:41:13.02
We're trying to get the cows up there.

551
0:41:14.44 --> 0:41:17.77
- Not too bad, Lady Ashley. - I've got him! I've got him!

552
0:41:19.11 --> 0:41:21.10
I think we're doing pretty well.

553
0:41:23.21 --> 0:41:26.21
You crazy take all this stuff.

554
0:41:26.25 --> 0:41:28.26
Where you think you going? Shanghai?

555
0:41:28.32 --> 0:41:30.47
A lady never knows what she might need.

556
0:41:49.81 --> 0:41:52.96
Run, Nullah! Run! Run!

557
0:41:53.01 --> 0:41:56.31
- Coppers! Coppers! - Tank! Run! Tank.

558
0:41:56.35 --> 0:41:58.90
Tank, Nullah! Tank!

559
0:42:00.22 --> 0:42:02.54
Bandy, coppers!

560
0:42:02.59 --> 0:42:05.31
Hurry up!

561
0:42:23.61 --> 0:42:24.44
Turn 'em loose.

562
0:42:24.45 --> 0:42:27.30
Go on. Get out. You two, check the east side.

563
0:42:27.34 --> 0:42:30.17
Move, move! Hurry up!

564
0:42:41.42 --> 0:42:43.50
Daisy's in the tank.

565
0:42:44.56 --> 0:42:47.68
Shh!

566
0:42:49.23 --> 0:42:51.18
Bandy, tea. Tea.

567
0:42:53.90 --> 0:42:56.92
Where's the creamy?

568
0:43:00.88 --> 0:43:02.83
Trackers.

569
0:43:14.29 --> 0:43:15.63
Nullah.

570
0:43:23.37 --> 0:43:28.04
Lady Ashley, Sergeant Callahan of the Northern Territory Police.

571
0:43:36.91 --> 0:43:38.76
Grab the float.

572
0:43:42.92 --> 0:43:46.04
I can't begin to tell you, Lady Ashley, how the...

573
0:43:46.09 --> 0:43:49.28
tragedy which befell your late husband has...

574
0:43:49.33 --> 0:43:54.00
wrung sympathy from the hearts of every civilized man and woman in the Northern Territory.

575
0:44:01.57 --> 0:44:03.93
Let me assure you, Lady Ashley...

576
0:44:03.97 --> 0:44:06.76
that the suspect, King George, will be brought to justice.

577
0:44:06.81 --> 0:44:11.33
But surely a witch doctor could conceal his own tracks, Sergeant, could he not?

578
0:44:11.38 --> 0:44:14.40
Makes no difference. It's only a matter of time.

579
0:44:40.61 --> 0:44:42.49
Shh!

580
0:44:52.29 --> 0:44:56.45
Oh, incidentally, I met up with your former manager, Neil Fletcher.

581
0:44:56.49 --> 0:45:00.49
He informed me that there's a half-blood Aboriginal child out here somewhere.

582
0:45:00.53 --> 0:45:04.70
I thought we might pick him up and put him in the good hands of the church.

583
0:45:06.40 --> 0:45:08.83
I will be sure to look out for him.

584
0:45:11.74 --> 0:45:13.75
Till we meet again, Lady Ashley.

585
0:45:15.88 --> 0:45:18.67
Get 'em in the back, Constable. Let's go.

586
0:45:33.90 --> 0:45:35.47
They're in the tank!

587
0:45:35.53 --> 0:45:36.70
Drover!

588
0:45:36.77 --> 0:45:40.57
Drover, help them! Quickly!

589
0:45:43.84 --> 0:45:46.53
Mama!

590
0:45:46.58 --> 0:45:48.69
Easy. That's it. I got you. I got you.

591
0:45:59.89 --> 0:46:02.51
Come on, Daisy. Come on.

592
0:46:24.91 --> 0:46:27.91
Daisy! Daisy!

593
0:46:27.95 --> 0:46:30.10
Daisy! Daisy!

594
0:46:33.66 --> 0:46:37.02
Daisy! Daisy.

595
0:46:37.06 --> 0:46:40.08
Daisy!

596
0:47:25.61 --> 0:47:27.65
Daisy.

597
0:47:49.26 --> 0:47:52.46
When someone dies in the Aboriginal culture...

598
0:47:52.50 --> 0:47:55.29
you're not supposed to say their name again.

599
0:47:58.21 --> 0:48:00.46
He needs motherin'.

600
0:48:00.51 --> 0:48:02.69
Mothering?

601
0:48:02.75 --> 0:48:04.76
Yep.

602
0:48:04.81 --> 0:48:09.34
You're a woman, so, go on, get down there.

603
0:48:09.38 --> 0:48:14.14
I'm, huh, I'm not, huh, huh.

604
0:48:14.19 --> 0:48:16.51
What?

605
0:48:18.59 --> 0:48:20.61
Good with children.

606
0:48:20.66 --> 0:48:23.82
Oh. Huh.

607
0:48:43.25 --> 0:48:45.26
Nullah.

608
0:48:46.89 --> 0:48:50.26
I wanted to extend my condolences.

609
0:48:50.29 --> 0:48:52.58
Go away.

610
0:49:16.02 --> 0:49:19.72
Would you, huh... Would you like to hear a story?

611
0:49:19.76 --> 0:49:22.51
What story?

612
0:49:24.53 --> 0:49:29.10
Huh, well, it's, huh, it's called,

613
0:49:36.54 --> 0:49:39.23
- It's called The Wizard of Oz. - What's a wizard?

614
0:49:39.27 --> 0:49:42.27
Well, a wizard is a sort of...

615
0:49:42.31 --> 0:49:43.72
magic man.

616
0:49:44.88 --> 0:49:47.03
Gulapa.

617
0:49:51.15 --> 0:49:53.14
Mama say I gulapa.

618
0:49:55.02 --> 0:49:57.38
- I magic man. - Really?

619
0:49:57.43 --> 0:49:59.71
I wizard man.

620
0:50:03.67 --> 0:50:06.56
We can't say Mama's name no more.

621
0:50:10.77 --> 0:50:12.78
No. Well.

622
0:50:12.84 --> 0:50:15.97
Huh, anyway, there's a girl...

623
0:50:16.01 --> 0:50:18.56
and there's a dog.

624
0:50:18.61 --> 0:50:22.44
Ruff. Ruff, ruff, ruff! And there's a tornado.

625
0:50:22.48 --> 0:50:25.78
- Well, no. It's a, in the film, it's a twister. - Who twister?

626
0:50:25.82 --> 0:50:29.42
Oh, no, no. Twister's not a person. It's like a big whoosh!

627
0:50:29.46 --> 0:50:31.57
- Like a storm. - Like the wet?

628
0:50:31.63 --> 0:50:34.09
Like the wet.

629
0:50:34.13 --> 0:50:38.46
Anyway, the story takes place in a, um

630
0:50:38.50 --> 0:50:41.26
well, a faraway land...

631
0:50:41.30 --> 0:50:43.31
called Oz.

632
0:50:44.84 --> 0:50:46.85
- This good story. - Oh, well.

633
0:50:46.91 --> 0:50:50.84
- Got song? - Yes, yes. Lots of songs.

634
0:50:50.88 --> 0:50:52.36
I like song.

635
0:50:53.92 --> 0:50:55.93
You sing'em me, I learn'em song.

636
0:50:55.98 --> 0:50:58.50
No, no, no. No.

637
0:50:59.86 --> 0:51:02.04
No.

638
0:51:04.09 --> 0:51:07.25
Well, I. Huh, some.

639
0:51:07.30 --> 0:51:09.65
- I'll sing a little. - Good.

640
0:51:09.70 --> 0:51:14.52
âª Somewhere over the, huh, the rainbow âª

641
0:51:14.57 --> 0:51:16.68
- Rainbow Serpent? - Yes.

642
0:51:16.74 --> 0:51:19.60
That bloody good. Keep going. You funny singer, but good song.

643
0:51:19.64 --> 0:51:23.04
Oh. âª Somewhere âª

644
0:51:26.52 --> 0:51:30.18
âª There's some birds and they âª

645
0:51:30.22 --> 0:51:32.30
- Huh. Oh. - Keep going. Come on.

646
0:51:32.35 --> 0:51:37.41
âª Someday I'll wish upon a star âª

647
0:51:37.46 --> 0:51:39.41
âª And âª

648
0:51:40.90 --> 0:51:43.52
- Come on. Sing more. - Huh. Yes.

649
0:51:43.57 --> 0:51:47.73
âª Wake up where the clouds are far behind âª

650
0:51:47.77 --> 0:51:51.73
âª Dreams really do come âª

651
0:51:57.48 --> 0:51:59.49
Oh!

652
0:52:01.25 --> 0:52:03.26
Dreaming song.

653
0:52:04.75 --> 0:52:06.71
Mrs. Boss...

654
0:52:06.76 --> 0:52:10.09
we gotta get those no good, cheeky bulls into the big, bloody metal ship.

655
0:52:11.09 --> 0:52:12.94
That's right.

656
0:52:13.00 --> 0:52:15.38
That's what dreaming songs tell us, Mrs. Boss.

657
0:52:16.73 --> 0:52:19.12
We've got to get those no good, big, bloody bulls...

658
0:52:19.17 --> 0:52:21.12
into that metal ship.

659
0:52:27.34 --> 0:52:31.34
I'm sorry. I thought he could I thought he could do it.

660
0:52:31.38 --> 0:52:34.87
Yeah, well, people don't change, Miss Ashley.

661
0:52:44.79 --> 0:52:47.29
Twister. Twister!

662
0:52:49.66 --> 0:52:55.61
- No desert comes drier than Kipling Flynn, milady! - Well done!

663
0:52:55.67 --> 0:52:58.26
Well done, Kipling!

664
0:52:58.31 --> 0:53:00.09
Hey!

665
0:53:00.14 --> 0:53:02.90
Flynn Kipling! Yea!

666
0:53:02.94 --> 0:53:05.84
Hey, hey!

667
0:53:05.88 --> 0:53:08.94
- Welcome! Welcome! - Hey, Nullah!

668
0:53:08.98 --> 0:53:11.17
All right.

669
0:53:11.22 --> 0:53:14.45
Well, Mr. Drover, I believe we have the appropriate number.

670
0:53:14.49 --> 0:53:17.11
- The appropriate number, huh? - Yes.

671
0:53:17.16 --> 0:53:20.02
Well, listen up. I'm only gonna say this once.

672
0:53:20.06 --> 0:53:23.59
I run the show. Everybody does exactly...

673
0:53:23.63 --> 0:53:25.59
as she's told.

674
0:53:26.70 --> 0:53:29.42
- Understood? - Understood.

675
0:53:32.37 --> 0:53:35.41
No matter your experience or your age, you pull your weight. Yes, boss.

676
0:53:35.48 --> 0:53:38.60
And above all, the Drover's law: no grog.

677
0:53:38.65 --> 0:53:41.47
Now...

678
0:53:41.52 --> 0:53:44.27
if there's a rush and the cattle are stampeding towards you...

679
0:53:44.32 --> 0:53:47.21
it's not much good prancing and dancing about on your show pony.

680
0:53:47.26 --> 0:53:50.28
There's only one thing cattle fear more than a man on a horse...

681
0:53:50.33 --> 0:53:53.25
and that's a man standing on his own two feet...

682
0:53:53.30 --> 0:53:55.81
staring 'em right between the eyes.

683
0:53:57.23 --> 0:54:00.16
Now, you sure you mob are still up for it?

684
0:54:00.20 --> 0:54:01.31
Mmm.

685
0:54:04.61 --> 0:54:06.79
You can count on us.

686
0:54:06.84 --> 0:54:08.85
Oh, crikey.

687
0:54:10.21 --> 0:54:13.51
Well, we're what we are.

688
0:54:13.55 --> 0:54:15.94
Gotta get to Darwin before the ship sails.

689
0:54:15.98 --> 0:54:18.00
Let's get cracking.

690
0:54:18.05 --> 0:54:19.97
The rest of you jokers follow me.

691
0:54:20.02 --> 0:54:22.03
- Hyah! - Hyah!

692
0:54:22.09 --> 0:54:25.11
I'll get the gate. Stay back. Don't let 'em scatter.

693
0:54:30.10 --> 0:54:32.52
There, mate. Push 'em over. Don't let 'em go down there.

694
0:54:34.20 --> 0:54:37.40
- That's it. - Get 'em up!

695
0:54:37.44 --> 0:54:40.77
- Whoo! - Hyah!

696
0:54:40.81 --> 0:54:42.96
Get up there!

697
0:54:54.69 --> 0:54:57.55
So we start cracking them whips...

698
0:54:57.59 --> 0:55:01.76
and driving them cheeky bulls all the way across the land...

699
0:55:02.73 --> 0:55:05.79
to that place they call'em Darwin.

700
0:55:09.24 --> 0:55:12.57
All right. We'll push 'em straight across here.

701
0:55:12.61 --> 0:55:14.02
Ho!

702
0:55:16.41 --> 0:55:19.90
Very good. Keep 'em movin'. Nice and steady.

703
0:55:22.15 --> 0:55:24.07
Go on!

704
0:55:24.12 --> 0:55:25.26
- Go on! - Hyah!

705
0:55:25.32 --> 0:55:26.77
Keep 'em moving.

706
0:55:29.93 --> 0:55:31.60
Giddy up! Giddap!

707
0:55:36.20 --> 0:55:39.67
While the war rages on in Europe, the Japanese are on the march.

708
0:55:39.70 --> 0:55:42.29
There are reports of an alliance between the warmongers...

709
0:55:42.34 --> 0:55:45.20
of Germany, Italy and Japan...

710
0:55:45.24 --> 0:55:49.27
which threatens to expand World War II to the shores of Australia.

711
0:55:49.31 --> 0:55:52.14
This is a war of the air, but on the ground...

712
0:55:52.18 --> 0:55:55.65
the War Office will announce who has won the army's contract...

713
0:55:55.68 --> 0:55:58.44
to supply good Aussie beef to the troops.

714
0:55:58.49 --> 0:56:00.81
Couple of days won't make any difference, Captain.

715
0:56:00.86 --> 0:56:02.81
Might as well sign the contract now, eh?

716
0:56:02.86 --> 0:56:05.72
I wouldn't be too sure of that, Mr. Carney.

717
0:56:05.76 --> 0:56:10.81
Air force chaps just spotted a big mob of cattle, 1,500 head, crossing the Marmont River.

718
0:56:10.87 --> 0:56:14.60
Marmont River? That's Faraway Downs.

719
0:56:14.64 --> 0:56:18.73
Are you, huh, running cattle out of Faraway Downs, Mr. Fletcher?

720
0:56:18.77 --> 0:56:20.82
Huh, no, no. I don't work there anymore.

721
0:56:20.88 --> 0:56:24.28
Well, I suppose Lady Ashley's droving the cattle herself.

722
0:56:24.31 --> 0:56:27.64
Someone must be helping her.

723
0:56:28.95 --> 0:56:31.60
That's right, Neil. Someone must be helping her.

724
0:56:44.40 --> 0:56:47.63
When Mrs. Boss first come to this land...

725
0:56:47.67 --> 0:56:49.62
she look but she not see.

726
0:56:55.38 --> 0:56:59.51
Now she got her eyes open for the first time.

727
0:57:11.43 --> 0:57:14.36
Some places got spirits.

728
0:57:14.40 --> 0:57:16.38
White fellas don't know.

729
0:57:17.40 --> 0:57:19.72
Some places no good to go.

730
0:57:33.18 --> 0:57:36.11
You gonna sing'em them cattle tonight?

731
0:57:36.15 --> 0:57:40.61
No, Nullah. Not me. I'm the orchestra.

732
0:57:40.66 --> 0:57:43.45
That's why I always carry this

733
0:57:43.49 --> 0:57:47.59
the famous J. Albert & Son boomerang harmonica.

734
0:57:47.63 --> 0:57:49.58
Can you play that rainbow song?

735
0:57:51.07 --> 0:57:56.15
Well, I've got the latest 100 songs of the hit parade here.

736
0:58:06.68 --> 0:58:08.86
I like that rainbow song.

737
0:58:08.92 --> 0:58:12.41
It's all about the dreaming.

738
0:58:12.45 --> 0:58:14.47
Gulapa not teach me that yet.

739
0:58:14.52 --> 0:58:16.30
Who's gulapa?

740
0:58:16.36 --> 0:58:19.92
He's my grandfather, King George.

741
0:58:21.26 --> 0:58:25.33
King George... is your grandfather?

742
0:58:25.37 --> 0:58:27.55
He teach me sing a fish song.

743
0:58:27.60 --> 0:58:29.56
He teach me sing down fear.

744
0:58:29.60 --> 0:58:34.26
Fear, evil spirit, wild beast.

745
0:58:34.31 --> 0:58:36.63
Gulapa teach me plenty songs.

746
0:58:36.68 --> 0:58:39.77
Gulapa teach me that day down the billabong.

747
0:58:48.76 --> 0:58:51.69
Mr. Drover, what is that chanting?

748
0:58:51.73 --> 0:58:54.62
Goolaj and Magarri singing the cattle.

749
0:58:54.66 --> 0:58:56.62
Just keeps them calm at night.

750
0:58:56.66 --> 0:59:01.09
We do it in shifts. Those boys will finish up in a couple hours. So, Bandy.

751
0:59:01.14 --> 0:59:02.68
- Yeah? - You show Mrs. Boss...

752
0:59:02.74 --> 0:59:04.85
- how it's done, all right? - Right.

753
0:59:04.91 --> 0:59:07.90
Sing Song, you and me are gonna serenade 'em till 3:00, and, huh...

754
0:59:07.94 --> 0:59:11.84
the safest shift is predawn, so that's the boy soprano and his orchestra.

755
0:59:11.88 --> 0:59:14.43
- All right? You're on till the sun comes up. - Yes, boss.

756
0:59:14.48 --> 0:59:16.49
All right. Everybody get some shuteye.

757
0:59:16.55 --> 0:59:18.98
Huh, Mr. Drover...

758
0:59:19.02 --> 0:59:22.85
I really don't think it's appropriate to work a child of Nullah's age like that.

759
0:59:22.89 --> 0:59:25.48
Now, I am more than willing to take his shift.

760
0:59:25.53 --> 0:59:28.28
- But, Mrs. Boss, I plenty old enough. - No.

761
0:59:28.33 --> 0:59:31.29
- I'm talking now, hmm? Manners. - Oi, oi, oi. Steady on.

762
0:59:31.33 --> 0:59:34.30
I'm talking. Look. Just relax, will ya?

763
0:59:34.34 --> 0:59:36.29
The boy's gotta pull his weight like everyone else.

764
0:59:36.34 --> 0:59:38.52
When I was his age, I was manning outstations.

765
0:59:38.57 --> 0:59:41.16
- Not everybody's you, Mr. Drover. - That's right.

766
0:59:41.21 --> 0:59:44.23
Not everyone's me. I'm the boss.

767
0:59:46.11 --> 0:59:48.23
You're on the 3:00 shift. All right?

768
0:59:48.28 --> 0:59:50.00
Yes, boss.

769
0:59:50.05 --> 0:59:52.54
- Night, boss. - 3:00 a.m.?

770
0:59:52.59 --> 0:59:55.38
- Relax, lady. He'll be fine. Good night. - Night, Mrs. Boss.

771
0:59:55.42 --> 0:59:58.21
Oh. Good night.

772
0:59:58.26 --> 1:00:00.30
Good night, Sing Song.

773
1:00:00.36 --> 1:00:02.61
You're on the 12:00 shift. I suggest you get some sleep.

774
1:00:02.64 --> 1:00:03.64
Night, Bandy.

775
1:00:03.70 --> 1:00:05.69
- Night, Nullah. - Good night, Flynn.

776
1:00:05.73 --> 1:00:08.25
Night, Nullah.

777
1:00:08.54 --> 1:00:10.39
Night, night, Jedda.

778
1:00:28.56 --> 1:00:32.52
Lord Ashley was killed by a glass-tipped spear.

779
1:00:32.56 --> 1:00:34.44
Are you sure?

780
1:00:34.50 --> 1:00:36.38
You and me secret.

781
1:01:15.14 --> 1:01:17.09
Rush! Rush!

782
1:01:21.84 --> 1:01:24.63
They're heading towards the cliff face!

783
1:01:24.68 --> 1:01:26.43
A stampede! Where's Nullah?

784
1:01:26.48 --> 1:01:30.18
Get on your horse and stay with Goolaj.

785
1:01:30.22 --> 1:01:34.28
Come on. Split up and circle the herd before they go over the edge!

786
1:01:34.32 --> 1:01:36.68
Sing Song, pack the camp. Get the hell out of there!

787
1:01:44.90 --> 1:01:47.32
Head them off!

788
1:01:51.71 --> 1:01:53.35
Don't let them split!

789
1:01:56.01 --> 1:01:58.53
Get in the front!

790
1:02:05.59 --> 1:02:07.98
Hyah! Hyah!

791
1:02:08.02 --> 1:02:12.02
Good boy! Come on! Pull them round! Pull them round!

792
1:02:15.43 --> 1:02:18.83
Nullah! You're too close to the edge!

793
1:02:18.87 --> 1:02:21.86
Courage, my boy! Courage!

794
1:02:21.90 --> 1:02:24.87
Well done, my boy!

795
1:02:34.22 --> 1:02:37.74
Nullah! We have to turn the herd!

796
1:02:47.06 --> 1:02:49.24
Hyah!

797
1:02:49.30 --> 1:02:51.25
Hey, hey!

798
1:02:51.30 --> 1:02:54.19
Never fear, Flynn is here!

799
1:02:54.24 --> 1:02:57.90
- Yeah, Flynn! - Hyah!

800
1:03:14.42 --> 1:03:15.66
Flynn!

801
1:03:29.14 --> 1:03:30.71
Flynn!

802
1:03:35.64 --> 1:03:37.60
Nullah, run!

803
1:04:15.85 --> 1:04:17.63
Nullah!

804
1:04:51.65 --> 1:04:54.37
Nullah!

805
1:04:54.42 --> 1:04:56.47
Nullah!

806
1:04:56.52 --> 1:04:59.79
Oh! Oh.

807
1:05:02.66 --> 1:05:04.85
Oh.

808
1:05:04.90 --> 1:05:07.32
It's all right. You're safe.

809
1:05:08.90 --> 1:05:10.86
I've got you.

810
1:05:10.91 --> 1:05:13.52
You're safe.

811
1:05:13.57 --> 1:05:15.59
You're safe with me.

812
1:05:22.68 --> 1:05:24.69
I'll stay with you.

813
1:05:37.70 --> 1:05:40.02
Hey.

814
1:05:40.07 --> 1:05:42.79
How's the little fella?

815
1:05:42.84 --> 1:05:45.70
- Oh, he's fine. He's fine. - Yeah.

816
1:05:47.18 --> 1:05:52.72
I have a feeling I might not be able to complete the next lesson.

817
1:05:58.02 --> 1:06:01.08
Right, old mate. I'm gonna get you some water, huh?

818
1:06:01.12 --> 1:06:06.37
Water's the last thing I want at this moment in my life.

819
1:06:06.43 --> 1:06:11.02
Under the wagon, a bottle of Poor Fella.

820
1:06:11.07 --> 1:06:14.86
I'm sorry, Drover. Just in case.

821
1:06:14.90 --> 1:06:18.70
Of course, mate. Of course.

822
1:06:18.74 --> 1:06:21.86
If you'd all share a drop.

823
1:06:23.11 --> 1:06:25.94
It would be a terrible shame to waste it.

824
1:06:31.32 --> 1:06:35.23
The spear, Nullah told me.

825
1:06:37.29 --> 1:06:40.89
A glass-tipped spear.

826
1:06:40.93 --> 1:06:43.58
Tell milady I'm sorry.

827
1:06:45.40 --> 1:06:47.89
I was a coward.

828
1:07:31.75 --> 1:07:35.97
We lost just about everything, except for a few swags and tins of beef.

829
1:07:36.02 --> 1:07:37.97
And this.

830
1:07:41.29 --> 1:07:45.02
I can't believe I was so insistent upon bringing these...

831
1:07:45.06 --> 1:07:47.01
silly things.

832
1:07:48.73 --> 1:07:51.52
It was Fletcher who did this, wasn't it?

833
1:07:53.47 --> 1:07:56.66
The last thing Flynn told me before he died was that

834
1:07:56.70 --> 1:07:59.63
that your husband was killed by a...

835
1:07:59.67 --> 1:08:01.86
by a glass-tipped spear...

836
1:08:01.91 --> 1:08:04.73
like the ornamental ones in the homestead.

837
1:08:04.78 --> 1:08:08.25
Glass-tipped is a Kimberley spear.

838
1:08:08.28 --> 1:08:09.99
King George is from Arnhem.

839
1:08:10.05 --> 1:08:13.38
Fletcher was trying to make it look like King George.

840
1:08:13.42 --> 1:08:17.19
- Fletcher. - It can't be proved.

841
1:08:17.22 --> 1:08:19.18
Sorry.

842
1:08:21.86 --> 1:08:24.25
Maitland.

843
1:08:44.05 --> 1:08:46.27
We can't let them win.

844
1:08:47.72 --> 1:08:49.68
We won't.

845
1:09:02.64 --> 1:09:04.59
Get 'em up!

846
1:09:05.94 --> 1:09:08.73
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

847
1:09:32.10 --> 1:09:35.59
They pushed on during the night.

848
1:09:35.64 --> 1:09:38.50
Maybe that little creamy has got the blackfella magic.

849
1:09:38.53 --> 1:09:39.53
Shut up, Bull!

850
1:09:41.24 --> 1:09:44.77
They're gonna need more than magic to get 'em to Darwin.

851
1:09:54.79 --> 1:09:56.83
Hey, Nullah.

852
1:09:56.89 --> 1:10:00.12
Nullah, after you're done, I need you to help hobble these horses. All right?

853
1:10:00.16 --> 1:10:02.11
Yes, boss.

854
1:10:04.47 --> 1:10:06.61
I never thought I'd see this day.

855
1:10:06.67 --> 1:10:10.47
- We're gonna break the Drover's law. - I plenty old enough too!

856
1:10:10.50 --> 1:10:14.34
Yes, you are, and that is why you are gonna keep an eye on the rest of us.

857
1:10:14.38 --> 1:10:17.03
All right?

858
1:10:17.08 --> 1:10:19.80
- All right, everyone. Let's be upstanding. - Good girl, Jedda. Here.

859
1:10:22.22 --> 1:10:24.00
To the memory of the gentleman.

860
1:10:24.05 --> 1:10:27.96
- To the gentleman. - To Flynn!

861
1:10:42.17 --> 1:10:44.99
I'd say one more before dinner.

862
1:11:00.72 --> 1:11:02.67
- Let's dance. - No.

863
1:11:02.72 --> 1:11:04.47
- Come on! - No. No.

864
1:11:04.53 --> 1:11:06.88
Come on. Please?

865
1:11:06.93 --> 1:11:09.48
- No. I don't know how. - It's easy. I'll show you.

866
1:11:09.53 --> 1:11:12.15
You put your hands on my shoulders.

867
1:11:17.30 --> 1:11:19.82
And you step back.

868
1:11:20.81 --> 1:11:23.39
- Back. No, no. - Oh, back. Sorry.

869
1:11:23.44 --> 1:11:25.46
- I'm a bad teacher. - Stop!

870
1:11:25.51 --> 1:11:27.70
You don't drink much, do you?

871
1:11:27.75 --> 1:11:29.70
No.

872
1:11:29.75 --> 1:11:33.78
I'll give it a go. Come on. I can do it. I can do it. All right?

873
1:12:16.60 --> 1:12:19.39
Now you do wrong side business?

874
1:12:21.20 --> 1:12:23.99
No, mate. No. We're just having a dance here.

875
1:12:25.67 --> 1:12:29.83
- Ceremonial dance? - Huh, yes. It's called the fox-trot.

876
1:12:29.88 --> 1:12:33.58
Fox dance? You gonna teach me that dance?

877
1:12:33.61 --> 1:12:36.30
- Huh, you're a bit too young for her, mate. - Nullah!

878
1:12:36.35 --> 1:12:40.48
Get down from that tree now! Got bad spirits up there.

879
1:12:40.52 --> 1:12:43.01
You're in big trouble.

880
1:12:44.86 --> 1:12:48.45
- Come on, Nullah. - Time to go to bed now.

881
1:12:48.50 --> 1:12:51.08
You know better than to go up in the tree.

882
1:12:51.13 --> 1:12:54.29
Have you ever fallen into wrong side business?

883
1:12:56.77 --> 1:13:00.03
Huh, yeah.

884
1:13:01.01 --> 1:13:03.63
- Oh. - Yeah. I was married once.

885
1:13:03.68 --> 1:13:06.87
- Really? - Mmm. To a lovely girl.

886
1:13:10.35 --> 1:13:13.37
That was before I went off to war.

887
1:13:20.06 --> 1:13:22.01
And what happened?

888
1:13:25.43 --> 1:13:27.61
Well, I marched off for Mother England...

889
1:13:27.67 --> 1:13:31.57
and by the time I came back, she was sick...

890
1:13:31.61 --> 1:13:34.40
with T.B.

891
1:13:34.44 --> 1:13:39.45
But back then, the hospitals wouldn't treat, um, blacks.

892
1:13:44.95 --> 1:13:47.95
Oh, right. I see. Yeah.

893
1:13:53.56 --> 1:13:55.57
Do you have children?

894
1:13:58.43 --> 1:14:01.40
- No. - Well, that's a shame.

895
1:14:02.47 --> 1:14:04.86
I think you would have made a great father.

896
1:14:07.98 --> 1:14:11.41
- You? - No.

897
1:14:13.08 --> 1:14:15.67
I can't.

898
1:14:16.72 --> 1:14:18.36
Oh.

899
1:14:21.06 --> 1:14:23.07
That's too bad.

900
1:14:27.36 --> 1:14:29.72
You would have made a great mother.

901
1:14:37.87 --> 1:14:39.82
Well, good night.

902
1:14:42.01 --> 1:14:44.02
- Good night. - Yeah.

903
1:15:17.11 --> 1:15:19.94
- Water no good, boss. - No.

904
1:15:19.98 --> 1:15:21.73
Might be Carney boys already been here, eh?

905
1:15:21.78 --> 1:15:24.47
There has to be water some other place.

906
1:15:24.52 --> 1:15:26.56
- Next bore is five days. - There has to be water.

907
1:15:26.62 --> 1:15:28.91
You can be sure Fletcher will have been there as well.

908
1:15:31.16 --> 1:15:33.15
- Hey, boss. - What?

909
1:15:33.19 --> 1:15:37.09
There's water three days' ride away.

910
1:15:37.13 --> 1:15:39.28
We'd have to cross the Kuraman.

911
1:15:39.33 --> 1:15:43.73
The Kuraman? That's Never Land. No.

912
1:15:43.77 --> 1:15:46.83
- We've got to try. - We can't.

913
1:15:46.87 --> 1:15:49.16
- We've got to try. - No one has drove the Never.

914
1:15:49.21 --> 1:15:51.63
There's nothing to guide you. You don't know where you are.

915
1:15:51.68 --> 1:15:55.62
You get caught out there, you're gonna lose more than your cattle.

916
1:15:59.92 --> 1:16:02.71
I'm sorry.

917
1:16:04.56 --> 1:16:06.51
Boss!

918
1:16:06.56 --> 1:16:08.51
Look!

919
1:16:37.22 --> 1:16:40.35
He a wizard. He gonna sing for us.

920
1:16:43.23 --> 1:16:45.08
Sing?

921
1:16:45.13 --> 1:16:47.99
He can find his way anywhere.

922
1:16:48.04 --> 1:16:51.50
The ancestors created songs for everything.

923
1:16:51.54 --> 1:16:54.54
For every rock and tree.

924
1:16:54.58 --> 1:16:58.84
They're all linked, so when gulapa, the magic man...

925
1:16:58.88 --> 1:17:02.58
sings them in order, he'll sing us to water.

926
1:17:02.62 --> 1:17:04.76
Even across the Never.

927
1:17:15.06 --> 1:17:17.42
And we went on for three days.

928
1:17:18.90 --> 1:17:22.66
Every day drier, hotter.

929
1:17:22.70 --> 1:17:25.06
All that dead land.

930
1:17:25.11 --> 1:17:28.13
Then come that big dust storm.

931
1:17:33.08 --> 1:17:35.40
Keep driving into the wind!

932
1:17:37.58 --> 1:17:39.63
Nullah, stay close to me!

933
1:17:39.69 --> 1:17:44.11
Them cattle stop moving. Magarri and Goolaj stop moving.

934
1:17:44.16 --> 1:17:46.34
We all stop moving.

935
1:17:49.73 --> 1:17:52.66
I'm gulapa.

936
1:17:52.70 --> 1:17:56.30
I magic man. I wizard man.

937
1:18:10.15 --> 1:18:12.74
Dead. All of them. That's what he said.

938
1:18:12.79 --> 1:18:15.81
The pilot swooped down to get a closer look.

939
1:18:15.86 --> 1:18:19.22
Dead as doorposts they were.

940
1:18:19.26 --> 1:18:22.86
- It's a real tragedy. - How terrible!

941
1:18:22.90 --> 1:18:24.91
And on the eve of the ball too.

942
1:18:24.97 --> 1:18:27.35
What were they doing in the Kuraman?

943
1:18:28.94 --> 1:18:30.92
Nothing personal, Captain...

944
1:18:30.97 --> 1:18:35.50
but I got a business to run, and you got an army to feed.

945
1:18:35.54 --> 1:18:37.93
So let's not muck about.

946
1:18:40.71 --> 1:18:44.55
I suppose it's not a real war unless someone's making a profit.

947
1:18:46.89 --> 1:18:50.12
- You got 'em ready to load, Neil? - Yeah, we're right to go.

948
1:18:50.16 --> 1:18:54.15
'Cause I got a feeling the captain's gonna put pen to paper.

949
1:18:54.19 --> 1:18:58.33
All hail the king. Yeah.

950
1:19:10.11 --> 1:19:12.87
Where'd he come from?

951
1:19:12.91 --> 1:19:15.30
Oh, look.

952
1:19:15.35 --> 1:19:18.75
Hello, little sweetie.

953
1:19:41.31 --> 1:19:44.17
What the bloody hell is that?

954
1:19:53.49 --> 1:19:55.67
Gentlemen!

955
1:19:57.42 --> 1:20:00.58
I'm Sarah Ashley, owner of Faraway Downs.

956
1:20:00.63 --> 1:20:05.52
We are making delivery of 1,500 head of prime F.D. branded shorthorns.

957
1:20:05.57 --> 1:20:08.25
We will require a holding yard.

958
1:20:08.30 --> 1:20:10.89
- We're full. - Says who?

959
1:20:10.94 --> 1:20:14.37
- The owner. - You must be Mr. Carney.

960
1:20:14.41 --> 1:20:16.66
Too right, love.

961
1:20:18.18 --> 1:20:20.22
Lady Ashley, I'm Emmett Dutton.

962
1:20:20.28 --> 1:20:22.29
I'm the officer in charge of livestock purchases.

963
1:20:22.35 --> 1:20:27.27
We will accept 20% less than what the Carney Cattle Company is asking.

964
1:20:27.32 --> 1:20:30.99
No can do, love. You're late. The contract's signed.

965
1:20:31.02 --> 1:20:34.90
This contract is not binding until the cattle are loaded.

966
1:20:38.87 --> 1:20:40.12
Load the bloody cattle now!

967
1:20:40.13 --> 1:20:42.89
We've got to load the cattle on the ship before Carney.

968
1:20:42.94 --> 1:20:45.80
- Get off your backsides! - You drive 'em straight down the wharf.

969
1:20:45.84 --> 1:20:48.80
I'll try and keep Carney's cattle in the yard.

970
1:20:52.58 --> 1:20:54.29
Load the bloody cattle now!

971
1:20:55.42 --> 1:20:58.82
- Drover! - Hyah!

972
1:21:02.29 --> 1:21:04.44
Load!

973
1:21:08.36 --> 1:21:11.02
You blokes, load!

974
1:21:13.20 --> 1:21:15.85
Hyah!

975
1:21:15.90 --> 1:21:18.96
Hey, Bull! Open the bloody crush!

976
1:21:19.01 --> 1:21:21.83
Come on! Close that flamin' gate!

977
1:21:37.49 --> 1:21:39.17
You missed the boat, sunshine.

978
1:21:39.23 --> 1:21:42.56
Yeah. Good luck, Drover, you drongo!

979
1:21:42.60 --> 1:21:44.61
Over here, Drover.

980
1:21:56.41 --> 1:21:58.87
Hyah!

981
1:22:14.26 --> 1:22:16.81
Drover!

982
1:22:16.86 --> 1:22:19.62
Push 'em straight down the wharf!

983
1:22:22.10 --> 1:22:24.65
Hah!

984
1:22:24.70 --> 1:22:28.04
Hyah!

985
1:22:34.31 --> 1:22:36.77
Hyah!

986
1:22:39.22 --> 1:22:41.37
Hyah!

987
1:22:43.59 --> 1:22:46.92
There are cattle being driven down the wharf.

988
1:22:46.96 --> 1:22:49.72
My husband must have a problem with the loading.

989
1:22:49.76 --> 1:22:53.09
They're not Carney cattle.

990
1:22:55.34 --> 1:22:57.79
- Mmm? - It's Lady Ashley.

991
1:23:00.41 --> 1:23:02.36
Get out of the way!

992
1:23:02.41 --> 1:23:04.90
Looks like, huh, we've got a bit of competition...

993
1:23:04.95 --> 1:23:07.53
back in the meat business.

994
1:23:16.76 --> 1:23:19.15
Now that's it!

995
1:23:19.19 --> 1:23:21.95
Hyah! Ho!

996
1:23:29.50 --> 1:23:32.56
Ho! Push them up!

997
1:23:34.67 --> 1:23:38.77
- Hyah! - Cheeky bulls down the wharf!

998
1:23:38.81 --> 1:23:41.47
Cheeky bulls down the wharf, Mrs. Boss!

999
1:24:06.81 --> 1:24:09.70
- Hyah! - Get him down the wharf. That's it, Nullah.

1000
1:24:09.74 --> 1:24:12.87
Get him up, Nullah.

1001
1:24:12.91 --> 1:24:16.18
I got the last big, bloody, cheeky bull in the big, bloody metal ship.

1002
1:24:16.22 --> 1:24:18.03
All right!

1003
1:24:19.12 --> 1:24:22.52
Yea! Yea!

1004
1:24:26.56 --> 1:24:29.72
Lady coming through. There's a lady coming through.

1005
1:24:33.83 --> 1:24:36.15
Two Poor Fella rums, Ivan.

1006
1:24:36.20 --> 1:24:38.89
Shut up!

1007
1:24:38.94 --> 1:24:41.96
No women. Ladies' lounge next door.

1008
1:24:44.51 --> 1:24:48.97
She's no lady, Ivan. She just drove a mob of cattle across the Never.

1009
1:24:49.02 --> 1:24:52.35
She deserves a drink like any man.

1010
1:24:52.39 --> 1:24:54.81
Too bloody right.

1011
1:24:54.85 --> 1:24:57.75
Too bloody right.

1012
1:25:09.20 --> 1:25:11.35
I never drink Poor Fella alone.

1013
1:25:17.91 --> 1:25:21.54
Crikey!

1014
1:25:21.58 --> 1:25:23.73
One, two, three!

1015
1:25:23.78 --> 1:25:27.68
âª Where's that jolly jumbuck you've got in your tucker bag âª

1016
1:25:30.86 --> 1:25:34.05
I didn't want to see a single beast from Faraway Downs...

1017
1:25:34.09 --> 1:25:37.09
set a hoof on that wharf, Neil.

1018
1:25:37.13 --> 1:25:40.29
But that's what happens when you send a boy to do a man's job.

1019
1:25:40.33 --> 1:25:42.95
Now, find out if she's going to the ball tomorrow night.

1020
1:25:43.00 --> 1:25:45.01
I'll take care of it myself.

1021
1:25:57.02 --> 1:26:00.88
So everybody get what they want.

1022
1:26:00.92 --> 1:26:02.93
Everybody happy.

1023
1:26:02.99 --> 1:26:06.36
Mrs. Boss is gonna sell Faraway Downs...

1024
1:26:06.39 --> 1:26:09.22
and go back to England.

1025
1:26:09.26 --> 1:26:11.22
Shh.

1026
1:26:11.26 --> 1:26:12.94
That's it. Good girl.

1027
1:26:13.00 --> 1:26:16.47
Drover, he get'em that horse, Capricornia.

1028
1:26:16.50 --> 1:26:18.46
That's it. Good girl.

1029
1:26:18.51 --> 1:26:21.97
Everybody happy, except for me.

1030
1:26:24.78 --> 1:26:27.29
'Cause I not white fella.

1031
1:26:27.35 --> 1:26:29.60
I not blackfella either.

1032
1:26:29.65 --> 1:26:31.66
Me half-caste.

1033
1:26:32.99 --> 1:26:35.61
Creamy.

1034
1:26:35.66 --> 1:26:37.77
Me belong no one.

1035
1:26:47.80 --> 1:26:50.19
Good girl.

1036
1:26:50.24 --> 1:26:53.97
Back, back, back. Back. Good.

1037
1:26:55.91 --> 1:27:01.40
Easy, easy. Good, good. That's it.

1038
1:27:06.39 --> 1:27:09.35
That's a good girl. That's it. Shh, shh, shh, shh.

1039
1:27:10.66 --> 1:27:13.52
You really do have a gift with horses.

1040
1:27:15.33 --> 1:27:18.19
Up. Up.

1041
1:27:20.53 --> 1:27:22.14
You look different.

1042
1:27:22.20 --> 1:27:26.92
I've agreed to be patroness at the ball at Government House tomorrow night.

1043
1:27:26.97 --> 1:27:28.96
Yeah? And?

1044
1:27:30.01 --> 1:27:33.48
Drover, I...

1045
1:27:33.51 --> 1:27:35.97
I'm going to finish what Maitland set out to do...

1046
1:27:36.02 --> 1:27:39.85
and I am going to bring Faraway Downs back to life.

1047
1:27:39.89 --> 1:27:41.87
I don't follow you.

1048
1:27:41.92 --> 1:27:44.14
Well, this is perfect. I'm going to need a manager.

1049
1:27:46.56 --> 1:27:50.09
Well, I thought that...

1050
1:27:50.13 --> 1:27:53.15
it would be a good job for you.

1051
1:27:56.14 --> 1:27:58.69
Anyway, I almost forgot something. I got a suit for you.

1052
1:27:58.74 --> 1:28:01.83
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop. Don't do that. - Do what?

1053
1:28:01.88 --> 1:28:04.23
The thing you do when you get a head full of ideas.

1054
1:28:04.28 --> 1:28:07.21
- Like crossing the Kuraman? - Come on, mate.

1055
1:28:07.25 --> 1:28:11.61
You don't know what you're talking about. Running a station? Manager?

1056
1:28:11.65 --> 1:28:14.95
I'm a drover. All right? No man hires me, no man fires me.

1057
1:28:16.99 --> 1:28:19.61
- So you don't want to go to the ball? - Ball?

1058
1:28:22.23 --> 1:28:24.18
Sarah.

1059
1:28:25.43 --> 1:28:28.80
I'm as good as black to that mob up there.

1060
1:28:28.84 --> 1:28:33.14
I mix with dingoes, not, not duchesses.

1061
1:28:35.07 --> 1:28:39.20
They keep out of my way, and I keep out of theirs.

1062
1:28:39.25 --> 1:28:41.26
That's the way it is.

1063
1:28:41.31 --> 1:28:45.19
Just because it is doesn't mean it should be.

1064
1:28:51.56 --> 1:28:53.57
But that's the way it is.

1065
1:29:04.27 --> 1:29:06.22
Cheer up, little fella.

1066
1:29:06.27 --> 1:29:09.57
You and that Chinaman gonna take me out on a big night at the pictures.

1067
1:29:09.61 --> 1:29:11.56
How?

1068
1:29:11.61 --> 1:29:14.16
You can't take half-caste to picture show.

1069
1:29:14.21 --> 1:29:18.61
- Coppers take him! - He won't be half-caste.

1070
1:29:18.65 --> 1:29:21.74
He got every right to be there.

1071
1:29:22.82 --> 1:29:24.83
We use magic.

1072
1:29:25.99 --> 1:29:28.78
You got every right to be there.

1073
1:29:33.47 --> 1:29:36.29
'Cause you're a special boy.

1074
1:29:36.34 --> 1:29:38.69
He's a special boy.

1075
1:29:38.74 --> 1:29:42.50
Nobody gonna stop you from going. Nobody.

1076
1:29:42.54 --> 1:29:45.20
âª Somewhere âª

1077
1:29:45.25 --> 1:29:48.61
âª Over the rainbow âª

1078
1:29:48.65 --> 1:29:53.67
âª Way up high âª

1079
1:29:53.72 --> 1:29:58.87
âª There's a land that I heard ofâª

1080
1:29:58.93 --> 1:30:02.12
âª Once in a lullaby âª

1081
1:30:03.90 --> 1:30:10.50
âª Somewhere over the rainbow âª

1082
1:30:10.57 --> 1:30:14.41
âª Skies are blue âª

1083
1:30:15.68 --> 1:30:18.40
âª And the dreams âª

1084
1:30:18.44 --> 1:30:21.47
âª That you dare to dream âª

1085
1:30:31.69 --> 1:30:33.74
How good of you, Lady Ashley...

1086
1:30:33.79 --> 1:30:37.09
to take an interest in Dr. Barker's work on the mission.

1087
1:30:37.13 --> 1:30:40.89
Well, actually, Administrator, my interest is of a more personal nature.

1088
1:30:40.93 --> 1:30:43.48
I must say, Lady Ashley.

1089
1:30:43.54 --> 1:30:46.03
- Smashing. - Would you excuse me?

1090
1:30:46.07 --> 1:30:48.69
Amongst the leading lights of Darwin.

1091
1:30:48.74 --> 1:30:51.67
I was wondering if you could introduce me to Dr. Barker.

1092
1:30:51.71 --> 1:30:53.72
- Sarah? - Ah, Captain Dutton.

1093
1:30:53.78 --> 1:30:57.21
Lady Ashley, I'll leave you in the capable hands of the captain.

1094
1:30:57.25 --> 1:31:00.51
I'm sure he would be happy to introduce you to Dr. Barker.

1095
1:31:00.55 --> 1:31:03.14
- I want to talk to you. - Her husband barely in the grave...

1096
1:31:03.19 --> 1:31:05.23
and there she is cavorting with the captain.

1097
1:31:05.29 --> 1:31:07.30
- His mother has passed away. - And that dress.

1098
1:31:07.36 --> 1:31:10.12
Yes. Bidding should go through the roof.

1099
1:31:10.16 --> 1:31:13.06
He is a little boy. He needs someone to look after him.

1100
1:31:13.10 --> 1:31:15.56
- Sarah! - I'm desperate to speak to Dr. Barker.

1101
1:31:15.60 --> 1:31:19.09
I'm going to adopt him. It's only a matter of time before they take him away.

1102
1:31:19.14 --> 1:31:22.50
Adopting an Aboriginal child is much more complicated than you realize.

1103
1:31:22.54 --> 1:31:26.31
Neil! Come on. I want to talk with Lady Ashley.

1104
1:31:26.35 --> 1:31:28.53
Yeah. No. We will later, love.

1105
1:31:28.58 --> 1:31:32.02
I don't mind if you bid for her in the auction tonight. I won't be jealous.

1106
1:31:32.05 --> 1:31:36.25
- She's an inspiration. - Yeah, she's full of surprises.

1107
1:31:36.29 --> 1:31:39.35
But surely, Doctor, life on the station with people who care for these children...

1108
1:31:39.39 --> 1:31:42.11
is far better than life on a government institution.

1109
1:31:42.16 --> 1:31:44.59
Oh. The auction.

1110
1:31:44.63 --> 1:31:47.79
Our gracious patroness, Lady Ashley!

1111
1:31:47.83 --> 1:31:49.91
Bravo!

1112
1:31:49.97 --> 1:31:51.98
Now, for the auction of the first dance.

1113
1:31:52.04 --> 1:31:56.50
The mixed-race children must be dislocated from the primitive, full-blood Aborigine.

1114
1:31:56.54 --> 1:32:00.14
- Do I hear a first bid? Please. - Five pounds here.

1115
1:32:00.18 --> 1:32:03.07
- Five pounds! - How else are we to breed the black out of them?

1116
1:32:03.12 --> 1:32:07.24
I bid more than that for a dance with Mrs. Allsop! Remember, it's for the mission.

1117
1:32:07.29 --> 1:32:10.75
Has anyone asked their mothers how they feel about this?

1118
1:32:10.79 --> 1:32:13.79
- Lady Ashley, please. - For the war effort, do I hear 20 pounds?

1119
1:32:13.83 --> 1:32:17.66
It's a fact of science that the Aboriginal mother soon forgets her offspring.

1120
1:32:17.70 --> 1:32:21.69
- Fifty pounds! - Fifty pounds!

1121
1:32:21.73 --> 1:32:23.92
- Seventy pounds! - Ninety five!

1122
1:32:23.97 --> 1:32:27.13
No mother forgets her child, Dr. Barker.

1123
1:32:27.17 --> 1:32:30.26
- Lady Ashley! - This is most inappropriate.

1124
1:32:30.31 --> 1:32:32.49
100!

1125
1:32:32.55 --> 1:32:36.67
- That is a new record. - We can't very well ask their fathers, can we?

1126
1:32:36.72 --> 1:32:39.54
- How dare you? - Going once!

1127
1:32:39.59 --> 1:32:42.95
- Or perhaps we should. - Going twice!

1128
1:32:42.99 --> 1:32:45.28
- After all, they're right here in this room. - That's a lie!

1129
1:32:45.32 --> 1:32:48.05
500 quid!

1130
1:32:51.76 --> 1:32:54.19
500 pounds!

1131
1:32:54.23 --> 1:32:56.96
Well, indeed.

1132
1:32:57.00 --> 1:32:58.96
If it isn't the man who

1133
1:32:59.01 --> 1:33:01.56
almost singlehandedly...

1134
1:33:01.61 --> 1:33:04.00
made the Australian beef industry...

1135
1:33:04.04 --> 1:33:07.24
what it is today.

1136
1:33:07.28 --> 1:33:11.59
Mr. King Carney of the Carney Cattle Company.

1137
1:33:15.72 --> 1:33:18.98
For the benefit of the missions.

1138
1:33:21.29 --> 1:33:25.89
Well, there's nothing more to say...

1139
1:33:25.93 --> 1:33:28.76
but let the king take his prize.

1140
1:33:34.97 --> 1:33:38.24
- Can I get a picture, please? Smile. - Ah.

1141
1:33:43.52 --> 1:33:45.97
Let me say, Lady Ashley, just how sorry I was...

1142
1:33:46.02 --> 1:33:48.48
to hear of your husband's death...

1143
1:33:48.52 --> 1:33:51.07
at the hands of that wild savage.

1144
1:33:51.12 --> 1:33:53.08
A savage, yes, Mr. Carney...

1145
1:33:53.13 --> 1:33:58.05
but you and I both know that my husband was not killed by an Aborigine.

1146
1:33:58.10 --> 1:34:00.18
No, I did not know that.

1147
1:34:00.23 --> 1:34:02.96
Perhaps you should ask Mr. Fletcher.

1148
1:34:05.27 --> 1:34:09.10
- Are you making an accusation? - Not one I can prove.

1149
1:34:09.14 --> 1:34:12.37
In business, I've been fortunate.

1150
1:34:12.41 --> 1:34:15.03
In family, a little less so.

1151
1:34:15.08 --> 1:34:18.81
I'm prepared to go to 75,000 pounds.

1152
1:34:18.85 --> 1:34:21.94
This is not about the money, Mr. Carney. There is a little boy.

1153
1:34:21.99 --> 1:34:24.38
There is a...

1154
1:34:24.42 --> 1:34:28.32
There are people who are living on the station...

1155
1:34:28.36 --> 1:34:30.37
for whom I am responsible.

1156
1:34:30.43 --> 1:34:32.31
And who will take care of them?

1157
1:34:32.37 --> 1:34:36.10
A cattle station is like a country.

1158
1:34:36.14 --> 1:34:39.73
And you have no one to look after it.

1159
1:34:39.77 --> 1:34:42.13
Now, I can offer protection...

1160
1:34:42.17 --> 1:34:46.90
to every man, woman and child.

1161
1:34:46.95 --> 1:34:48.90
And child?

1162
1:34:50.55 --> 1:34:52.80
You will do that?

1163
1:34:52.85 --> 1:34:56.34
How can I keep you at your word?

1164
1:34:56.39 --> 1:34:59.48
I'll put it in the contract.

1165
1:34:59.53 --> 1:35:02.62
King Carney and Lady Ashley. That was a marvelous treat.

1166
1:35:05.00 --> 1:35:09.27
No one can close a deal more quickly than King Carney.

1167
1:35:10.30 --> 1:35:13.20
Now, the raffle for the war effort.

1168
1:35:13.24 --> 1:35:15.86
The last flying boat...

1169
1:35:15.91 --> 1:35:18.53
leaves tomorrow because of the war.

1170
1:35:24.72 --> 1:35:28.81
Will I tell my lawyer to draw up a contract?

1171
1:35:28.85 --> 1:35:33.90
But the true blue Australian man like King Carney is.

1172
1:35:44.97 --> 1:35:46.96
Inform your lawyer.

1173
1:35:47.01 --> 1:35:48.45
Huh...

1174
1:36:06.53 --> 1:36:11.34
Inform your lawyer that Faraway Downs is no longer for sale.

1175
1:36:19.77 --> 1:36:21.73
Fox-trot!

1176
1:36:55.11 --> 1:36:57.22
Here you are.

1177
1:36:57.28 --> 1:37:00.98
Well, you didn't think I was gonna waste my dance lesson, did you?

1178
1:37:04.68 --> 1:37:06.94
Let's really give the bastards something to talk about, huh?

1179
1:37:06.99 --> 1:37:10.32
Oh, crikey.

1180
1:37:13.03 --> 1:37:15.14
She's invited that man.

1181
1:37:16.16 --> 1:37:18.41
- Hey, Doris. - Get you a drink, Drover?

1182
1:37:18.46 --> 1:37:21.43
Beer would be good. Hello, love. Nice dress.

1183
1:37:33.08 --> 1:37:35.37
- All right. - Fox dance?

1184
1:37:35.41 --> 1:37:37.43
- Fox dance. - Mmm.

1185
1:37:39.15 --> 1:37:42.01
- Back. Back. - Step.

1186
1:37:42.05 --> 1:37:44.01
- Step. - Sorry.

1187
1:38:06.75 --> 1:38:08.76
Let's clear out of here.

1188
1:38:24.23 --> 1:38:28.50
- There it is. First storm of the wet. - Ahh.

1189
1:38:30.37 --> 1:38:32.38
What's it like?

1190
1:38:32.44 --> 1:38:34.01
It's beautiful.

1191
1:38:34.07 --> 1:38:36.06
There's millions of birds.

1192
1:38:36.11 --> 1:38:40.47
Creeks turn into rivers, dry plains into lakes.

1193
1:38:40.51 --> 1:38:44.24
Faraway Downs will be reborn as an island

1194
1:38:44.28 --> 1:38:46.47
green and flowering and fat with life.

1195
1:38:46.52 --> 1:38:48.70
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Quick, quick, quick!

1196
1:38:48.75 --> 1:38:51.27
We'll be cut off from the rest of the world!

1197
1:38:52.83 --> 1:38:55.21
- Sarah. - Mmm?

1198
1:38:55.26 --> 1:38:58.23
In the dry I'll be gone, droving.

1199
1:39:08.07 --> 1:39:10.62
But right now it's raining.

1200
1:39:30.83 --> 1:39:33.29
Can you help me? Can you help me?

1201
1:39:33.33 --> 1:39:35.41
You don't need to be helped any longer.

1202
1:39:35.47 --> 1:39:39.31
You've always had the power to go back to Kansas. I have?

1203
1:39:39.37 --> 1:39:41.36
But why didn't you tell her before?

1204
1:39:41.41 --> 1:39:43.42
Because she wouldn't have believed me.

1205
1:39:44.78 --> 1:39:46.86
My darling Cath!

1206
1:39:46.91 --> 1:39:49.57
Daddy!

1207
1:40:08.97 --> 1:40:10.92
Hey, Drover.

1208
1:40:34.33 --> 1:40:36.31
Maitland Ashley met his death...

1209
1:40:36.36 --> 1:40:40.09
at the hands of a wild savage, did he?

1210
1:40:40.13 --> 1:40:43.36
You're not part of any plan concerning this family.

1211
1:40:43.40 --> 1:40:45.41
Nothing's in your name...

1212
1:40:45.47 --> 1:40:49.64
and if anything should happen to my darling Cath, you lose everything.

1213
1:41:00.35 --> 1:41:04.05
There's no place like home.

1214
1:42:41.65 --> 1:42:45.28
Just like Drover say, that rain make everything come alive.

1215
1:42:46.43 --> 1:42:49.01
That land, it grow green and fat...

1216
1:42:49.06 --> 1:42:52.50
and we all go back to Faraway Downs.

1217
1:42:53.77 --> 1:42:56.79
Mrs. Boss happy. Drover happy.

1218
1:42:56.84 --> 1:42:59.93
Even that copper Callahan happy.

1219
1:42:59.97 --> 1:43:02.59
Mrs. Boss say he likes her tea so much...

1220
1:43:02.64 --> 1:43:05.94
it gives him a blind eye

1221
1:43:05.98 --> 1:43:08.26
make me invisible, keep me safe.

1222
1:43:10.25 --> 1:43:12.26
I hear for the first time...

1223
1:43:12.32 --> 1:43:14.57
that thing called...

1224
1:43:14.62 --> 1:43:16.91
Christmas.

1225
1:43:27.00 --> 1:43:30.12
Then the rain, it stops.

1226
1:43:31.67 --> 1:43:35.65
And that Drover, he go droving.

1227
1:43:38.24 --> 1:43:42.24
That Mrs. Boss, she always misses Drover.

1228
1:43:42.28 --> 1:43:45.48
But I know he's gonna come back.

1229
1:43:54.66 --> 1:43:56.67
Whoo! Yeah!

1230
1:44:01.23 --> 1:44:03.49
King George tell me you gotta be looking out.

1231
1:44:03.54 --> 1:44:08.14
'Cause that crock, he always watching, he always waiting.

1232
1:44:28.56 --> 1:44:30.64
Hah! Get up!

1233
1:44:38.30 --> 1:44:40.89
That Fletcher, he the new king now.

1234
1:44:50.75 --> 1:44:55.11
Emmett, why didn't you radio? I'm so glad you're here.

1235
1:44:55.15 --> 1:44:56.93
Would you get some tea, Bandy?

1236
1:45:00.99 --> 1:45:03.35
Geez, you done the place up nice.

1237
1:45:03.40 --> 1:45:06.62
I hope you don't mind. Bandy let me in.

1238
1:45:07.93 --> 1:45:11.40
My father would have been proud.

1239
1:45:11.44 --> 1:45:13.39
It's bloody beautiful.

1240
1:45:13.44 --> 1:45:17.30
Geez, I bet you got all the mod cons.

1241
1:45:17.34 --> 1:45:19.77
What do you want?

1242
1:45:21.91 --> 1:45:25.38
What I've always wanted Faraway Downs.

1243
1:45:25.42 --> 1:45:27.37
Bandy, call the men.

1244
1:45:27.42 --> 1:45:29.57
Bunch'em up, Mr. Fletcher needs to be escorted off the property

1245
1:45:29.62 --> 1:45:32.24
Callahan won't be having any more cups of tea.

1246
1:45:33.49 --> 1:45:35.57
I will though. Cup of tea.

1247
1:45:35.63 --> 1:45:39.06
Thanks, Bandy. You know how I like it. Yeah.

1248
1:45:40.13 --> 1:45:42.89
It's all right, Bandy.

1249
1:45:42.94 --> 1:45:45.32
You know, these days, I can pull a few strings.

1250
1:45:45.37 --> 1:45:48.09
I can probably bring your creamy in, if you like.

1251
1:45:48.14 --> 1:45:52.07
Or... I can talk to Dr. Barker and get you guardianship.

1252
1:45:52.11 --> 1:45:54.76
- I will never sell you my land. - Your land?

1253
1:45:54.81 --> 1:45:57.71
My family worked this property for three generations.

1254
1:45:57.75 --> 1:46:00.26
My father died making people like you rich.

1255
1:46:00.32 --> 1:46:02.57
Faraway Downs belongs to me.

1256
1:46:04.92 --> 1:46:09.34
Just like... you believe the little creamy belongs to you.

1257
1:46:10.70 --> 1:46:12.95
I'll pay you what it's worth.

1258
1:46:13.00 --> 1:46:16.80
Can use the money, go south, get the little one an education.

1259
1:46:16.84 --> 1:46:19.33
I'll go to the highest levels of government, to the High Court.

1260
1:46:19.37 --> 1:46:21.32
Beyond this country, if I have to.

1261
1:46:21.37 --> 1:46:23.59
An unmarried woman, living with the likes of the Drover?

1262
1:46:23.64 --> 1:46:27.84
I will tell your wife he is your son!

1263
1:46:27.88 --> 1:46:30.77
That would be a mistake.

1264
1:46:34.59 --> 1:46:36.54
Kimberley spear.

1265
1:46:38.52 --> 1:46:40.98
Glass-tipped.

1266
1:46:42.43 --> 1:46:44.75
Real collector's items.

1267
1:46:46.40 --> 1:46:50.63
Oh! You're missing one.

1268
1:46:50.67 --> 1:46:54.30
Anyway, I was just out here, checking on all the properties.

1269
1:46:54.34 --> 1:46:57.64
Might do a little buffalo hunting later. Yeah.

1270
1:46:57.68 --> 1:46:59.93
Oh.

1271
1:46:59.98 --> 1:47:02.94
Did you hear about the king?

1272
1:47:02.98 --> 1:47:06.31
Terrible accident. Yeah.

1273
1:47:06.35 --> 1:47:08.47
Very dangerous place out here, even for locals...

1274
1:47:08.52 --> 1:47:10.63
like the Drover and the little creamy.

1275
1:47:10.69 --> 1:47:12.98
You with me?

1276
1:47:13.03 --> 1:47:15.07
Anyway...

1277
1:47:15.13 --> 1:47:18.18
you ought to think about it, Lady Ashley.

1278
1:47:18.23 --> 1:47:22.10
After all, pride's not power.

1279
1:47:29.84 --> 1:47:32.16
The Drover mustn't know.

1280
1:47:33.25 --> 1:47:36.00
Hyah! Hyah!

1281
1:47:36.05 --> 1:47:39.21
Drover! It's the Drover!

1282
1:47:46.83 --> 1:47:48.78
Hey! Yeah!

1283
1:48:03.84 --> 1:48:05.92
Come on, you two! Wake up!

1284
1:48:05.98 --> 1:48:08.30
Come on!

1285
1:48:08.35 --> 1:48:11.28
- Come on. Wake up! We got brumbies to break. - All right, all right.

1286
1:48:23.63 --> 1:48:28.25
Yeah, break him. Ride that brumby! Ride him! Ride him!

1287
1:48:28.30 --> 1:48:33.76
Yea, Drover! Ride him! Yeah, Drover! Drover!

1288
1:48:35.61 --> 1:48:38.43
- You a man, Drover? - Yeah, I try to be.

1289
1:48:38.48 --> 1:48:41.06
Sometimes man got to get away from woman.

1290
1:48:41.11 --> 1:48:43.07
Maybe.

1291
1:48:43.12 --> 1:48:46.27
- That's why you go droving. - I go droving 'cause that's my job.

1292
1:48:46.32 --> 1:48:49.25
If you don't go droving, you not a man.

1293
1:48:52.32 --> 1:48:54.78
All right, boys. That'll do.

1294
1:48:54.83 --> 1:48:56.78
Bring 'em down to the back paddock, will you?

1295
1:48:56.83 --> 1:48:58.91
King George tell me I gotta go walkabout.

1296
1:48:58.96 --> 1:49:03.20
If I a man, I gotta go walkabout. Learn'em be a man.

1297
1:49:04.67 --> 1:49:06.62
Yeah.

1298
1:49:06.67 --> 1:49:09.93
Listen, it's up to Mrs. Boss what you do, all right?

1299
1:49:09.98 --> 1:49:12.80
Come on inside, boys. It's time for dinner.

1300
1:49:12.84 --> 1:49:15.13
I'm coming. Jedda, come on!

1301
1:49:15.18 --> 1:49:17.19
Come on, Jedda.

1302
1:49:21.92 --> 1:49:25.25
One day, Captain Dutton came and visit us.

1303
1:49:25.29 --> 1:49:28.59
He tell Drover about the big army drove.

1304
1:49:29.51 --> 1:49:31.78
And we need the best stockmen possible.

1305
1:49:31.83 --> 1:49:35.16
- It may take six months or so. - Overland.

1306
1:49:35.20 --> 1:49:38.03
Absolutely not. You just got back.

1307
1:49:46.01 --> 1:49:48.56
What's wrong?

1308
1:49:48.61 --> 1:49:51.91
I'm just not used to people making decisions for me. That's all.

1309
1:49:51.95 --> 1:49:55.38
I was just expressing an opinion.

1310
1:49:55.42 --> 1:49:58.35
Captain Dutton was telling me about this wonderful School of the Air.

1311
1:49:58.39 --> 1:50:01.55
It's conducted all across the country.

1312
1:50:01.59 --> 1:50:04.38
He wants to go walkabout with King George.

1313
1:50:04.43 --> 1:50:07.49
That's ridiculous. He's a little boy. It's not safe.

1314
1:50:07.53 --> 1:50:11.69
He'd be safer in Arnhem Land than he would be hanging around here.

1315
1:50:11.74 --> 1:50:14.25
- I thought you said. - You can't change him, Sarah.

1316
1:50:15.91 --> 1:50:18.26
I thought you said it had nothing to do with you.

1317
1:50:18.31 --> 1:50:20.39
It doesn't.

1318
1:50:20.45 --> 1:50:24.25
It's just sooner or later, you're gonna have to let that boy go.

1319
1:50:26.55 --> 1:50:28.84
I don't know what you're talking about.

1320
1:50:28.89 --> 1:50:32.55
If he doesn't go through ceremony, he'll have no country.

1321
1:50:32.59 --> 1:50:35.25
He'll have no story, no dreaming.

1322
1:50:36.93 --> 1:50:38.94
And he'll be all alone.

1323
1:50:42.87 --> 1:50:45.38
This big army drove.

1324
1:50:45.44 --> 1:50:48.53
- Let's have dinner, shall we? - I'm gonna take it.

1325
1:51:50.14 --> 1:51:52.82
Time to go walkabout, Mrs. Boss.

1326
1:51:54.01 --> 1:51:57.67
- You belong here. - No, Mrs. Boss.

1327
1:52:33.21 --> 1:52:36.47
Sarah, I gotta go.

1328
1:52:36.51 --> 1:52:38.47
Sarah!

1329
1:52:39.92 --> 1:52:41.87
Drover!

1330
1:52:43.22 --> 1:52:45.71
Drover!

1331
1:52:48.43 --> 1:52:50.71
He's not down at the billabong!

1332
1:52:50.76 --> 1:52:52.25
Then he's gone walkabout.

1333
1:52:52.26 --> 1:52:55.53
He wouldn't have just left without saying goodbye.

1334
1:52:55.57 --> 1:52:58.50
Get the pack horse ready. We're going up to Punctuation Point.

1335
1:52:58.54 --> 1:53:00.49
- Sing Song? - Yes?

1336
1:53:00.54 --> 1:53:03.26
- Tin food. We're going after him. - You're not listening.

1337
1:53:03.31 --> 1:53:06.13
- What? - Sarah, he's gone on walkabout!

1338
1:53:06.18 --> 1:53:08.03
Oh, come on, Drover. He is a child.

1339
1:53:08.08 --> 1:53:12.57
Well, he's not our child! He's an Aboriginal child! He's gone walkabout!

1340
1:53:12.62 --> 1:53:14.87
- Bandy! - The next time you see him...

1341
1:53:14.92 --> 1:53:16.93
will be when he wants to see you.

1342
1:53:16.99 --> 1:53:19.61
He'll be halfway to Arnhem Land by now. You'll never find him.

1343
1:53:19.66 --> 1:53:22.59
You could find him. You know that land better than anyone.

1344
1:53:22.63 --> 1:53:24.91
- You and Magarri can find him. - And do what, huh?

1345
1:53:24.96 --> 1:53:28.05
Bring him back here and lock him up? You could start your own mission.

1346
1:53:28.10 --> 1:53:31.59
Oh! You're just trying to be clever because you don't want to be responsible.

1347
1:53:31.64 --> 1:53:33.42
He's not my son!

1348
1:53:36.04 --> 1:53:37.99
What did you say?

1349
1:53:40.81 --> 1:53:44.08
- I better go. - Don't leave! Drover, don't.

1350
1:53:45.25 --> 1:53:47.80
I understood when you said you had to be free.

1351
1:53:47.85 --> 1:53:52.18
I understood that, but that was between you and me.

1352
1:53:52.22 --> 1:53:54.48
But it's different now.

1353
1:53:54.53 --> 1:53:56.71
We've got Nullah.

1354
1:53:58.20 --> 1:54:00.15
- I gotta go. - I need you to stay.

1355
1:54:00.20 --> 1:54:03.06
- I'll be back in six months. - I need you to stay with me!

1356
1:54:03.10 --> 1:54:05.25
And if you can't do that, then I.

1357
1:54:05.30 --> 1:54:07.92
I would prefer it if you didn't return.

1358
1:54:12.48 --> 1:54:14.46
All right.

1359
1:54:14.51 --> 1:54:16.47
You're the boss.

1360
1:54:20.35 --> 1:54:23.18
Drover.

1361
1:54:34.00 --> 1:54:37.00
I can feel them bad spirits coming...

1362
1:54:37.04 --> 1:54:40.00
so I chase after that King George.

1363
1:54:40.04 --> 1:54:43.70
But that Callahan, he been stopped drinking Mrs. Boss's tea.

1364
1:54:48.75 --> 1:54:52.78
He lose his blind eye, and I not invisible anymore.

1365
1:54:59.39 --> 1:55:01.75
Jedda!

1366
1:55:03.76 --> 1:55:06.31
Fletcher, we've apprehended that young'un.

1367
1:55:07.03 --> 1:55:12.18
And in the course of our duties, we arrested the suspected murderer of Lord Ashley.

1368
1:55:12.24 --> 1:55:13.85
King George.

1369
1:55:20.85 --> 1:55:23.84
No!

1370
1:55:25.18 --> 1:55:28.01
You finally lifted the game, Callahan. Good on you.

1371
1:55:28.05 --> 1:55:31.32
- Things are looking up. - The militarization of Darwin.

1372
1:55:31.36 --> 1:55:34.76
Their cattle yards are alive with military activity...

1373
1:55:34.79 --> 1:55:38.56
and the Carney Cattle office, once that proud icon of Darwin...

1374
1:55:38.60 --> 1:55:41.39
is now military headquarters.

1375
1:55:41.43 --> 1:55:44.19
At 6:15 a.m. local time...

1376
1:55:44.24 --> 1:55:48.23
the United States Pacific Fleet was attacked at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii...

1377
1:55:48.27 --> 1:55:50.66
by the empire of Japan.

1378
1:55:50.71 --> 1:55:54.07
The United States has joined the war.

1379
1:55:55.21 --> 1:55:58.21
As the Japanese horde pours southward...

1380
1:55:58.25 --> 1:56:01.95
the final evacuation of Darwin is under way.

1381
1:56:10.06 --> 1:56:13.26
Get those boxes cleared on the double!

1382
1:56:13.30 --> 1:56:15.15
- Come on. - This way, boys.

1383
1:56:15.20 --> 1:56:16.88
Quickly. Quickly.

1384
1:56:35.52 --> 1:56:38.42
Hey, creamy! Creamy!

1385
1:56:38.46 --> 1:56:41.11
Doesn't your mommy want you?

1386
1:56:51.84 --> 1:56:54.33
- You filthy creamy! - Come on.

1387
1:56:54.37 --> 1:56:57.30
Come, my child. Come on! Come on, my child.

1388
1:56:57.34 --> 1:56:58.99
Creamy! Hey, creamy!

1389
1:57:22.23 --> 1:57:23.61
- Excuse me. - Nullah!

1390
1:57:23.67 --> 1:57:25.31
- Lady Ashley. - It's Lady Ashley.

1391
1:57:25.37 --> 1:57:27.59
- Father Benedict, you deal with this. - Nullah!

1392
1:57:27.64 --> 1:57:30.33
- Mrs. Boss! Mrs. Boss! - No! This is madness!

1393
1:57:30.38 --> 1:57:33.30
Mrs. Boss, don't let them take me away! I don't want to go!

1394
1:57:33.34 --> 1:57:35.67
Was she hugging a pickaninny?

1395
1:57:35.71 --> 1:57:37.79
People do the most extraordinary things.

1396
1:57:37.85 --> 1:57:40.94
- Go on. - I don't want to go! Mrs. Boss!

1397
1:57:40.99 --> 1:57:43.63
It'll be all right. -These poor unfortunates will be safe in God's hands.

1398
1:57:43.69 --> 1:57:46.15
These are not unfortunates! These are children!

1399
1:57:46.19 --> 1:57:49.19
These are no different than the children you are taking south to protect!

1400
1:57:49.23 --> 1:57:52.23
- Don't let them take me away! No! - Nullah! Nullah!

1401
1:57:52.26 --> 1:57:54.88
- She's humiliating herself. - Please help me!

1402
1:57:54.93 --> 1:57:57.05
- We've got to help her. - Lady Ashley!

1403
1:57:57.10 --> 1:57:59.89
- Help me! That's my child. - I understand what you're saying.

1404
1:57:59.94 --> 1:58:02.29
- Please! Nullah! - You don't have an essential job. You must evacuate.

1405
1:58:02.34 --> 1:58:06.14
- Mrs. Boss, don't let them take me away. - The church has a plan for them.

1406
1:58:06.18 --> 1:58:08.97
To leave those children behind while we send ours to safety?

1407
1:58:09.01 --> 1:58:11.67
- Control yourself, Catherine. - How can you all be so heartless?

1408
1:58:11.72 --> 1:58:14.65
You be a brave boy for me. You be brave.

1409
1:58:14.69 --> 1:58:18.28
Neil, I want you to do something about this. I want you to help Lady Ashley.

1410
1:58:18.32 --> 1:58:20.71
Yeah, now, look, I could probably sort it out.

1411
1:58:20.76 --> 1:58:23.52
Show the ladies their cabins, and I'll see what I can do.

1412
1:58:23.56 --> 1:58:25.13
Come on, ladies. To the upper decks.

1413
1:58:25.20 --> 1:58:27.21
I will come find you, whatever happens.

1414
1:58:27.27 --> 1:58:29.59
Whatever it takes, we'll be together again. I promise.

1415
1:58:29.63 --> 1:58:33.86
- I believe you, Mrs. Boss. - Come along, child. Quickly. Quickly.

1416
1:58:33.91 --> 1:58:35.86
Mrs. Boss.

1417
1:58:37.24 --> 1:58:40.68
- I sing you to me. - You be brave.

1418
1:58:42.41 --> 1:58:45.07
- Nullah. - Come, boy. Come quickly.

1419
1:58:48.75 --> 1:58:51.44
Nullah! It'll be all right!

1420
1:58:57.00 --> 1:59:00.02
I will find you! I will!

1421
1:59:07.94 --> 1:59:11.20
Nullah! Nullah!

1422
1:59:18.42 --> 1:59:21.44
I sing you to me, Mrs. Boss!

1423
1:59:21.49 --> 1:59:24.58
And I will hear you, my darling!

1424
1:59:30.66 --> 1:59:33.12
There's a radio tower on Mission Island...

1425
1:59:33.16 --> 1:59:36.60
directly in the path of the oncoming Japanese.

1426
1:59:36.63 --> 1:59:39.15
Be the first place the Japs hit.

1427
1:59:40.71 --> 1:59:42.66
You're monstrous.

1428
1:59:46.68 --> 1:59:49.77
I'll have the original contract with the original offer drawn up and ready.

1429
1:59:49.81 --> 1:59:54.01
You can get yourself a room at Ivan's, and I'll get you a job with Cath at H.Q.

1430
1:59:54.05 --> 1:59:58.08
I'll give you a call. You will do this, Lady Ashley.

1431
1:59:58.12 --> 2:00:01.99
After all, pride's not power.

1432
2:00:05.63 --> 2:00:08.79
Yeah, pride's not power.

1433
2:00:39.00 --> 2:00:41.55
Mission Island to H.Q.

1434
2:00:41.60 --> 2:00:44.86
Mission Island to H.Q. Visibility good.

1435
2:00:44.90 --> 2:00:47.90
All clear. Over and out.

1436
2:00:49.61 --> 2:00:53.74
âª Ave Maria âª

1437
2:00:53.78 --> 2:00:58.02
I was on Mission Island locked for two whole months.

1438
2:00:59.05 --> 2:01:03.01
Mrs. Boss promised she'd come for me...

1439
2:01:03.05 --> 2:01:05.57
so I play my magic song.

1440
2:01:10.06 --> 2:01:12.05
But that Drover

1441
2:01:12.10 --> 2:01:14.75
him been gone far, far away...

1442
2:01:14.80 --> 2:01:17.22
on that big army drove.

1443
2:01:18.30 --> 2:01:21.67
Him been gone so long, so far away...

1444
2:01:31.95 --> 2:01:34.10
What? No whistling?

1445
2:01:34.15 --> 2:01:36.51
Just not that tune.

1446
2:01:49.90 --> 2:01:52.39
Not that one either.

1447
2:01:52.44 --> 2:01:54.86
No music?

1448
2:01:54.91 --> 2:01:57.05
You must be properly hurtin' for Mrs. Boss.

1449
2:01:57.11 --> 2:01:59.06
Shut your damper hole, will ya?

1450
2:01:59.11 --> 2:02:01.70
I can see why Mrs. Boss gave you the boot.

1451
2:02:01.75 --> 2:02:04.20
- You wanna know why she gave me the boot? - Yeah.

1452
2:02:04.25 --> 2:02:06.94
'Cause I wouldn't stop Nullah from going walkabout.

1453
2:02:06.98 --> 2:02:08.97
He went walkabout?

1454
2:02:09.02 --> 2:02:11.57
Yeah. I tried to explain to her what that means, but.

1455
2:02:11.62 --> 2:02:14.45
- See him go? - Nah.

1456
2:02:14.49 --> 2:02:17.21
So he's gone.

1457
2:02:17.26 --> 2:02:20.96
- Yeah. I told you. He went walkabout. - You don't know?

1458
2:02:21.00 --> 2:02:22.92
Eh?

1459
2:02:22.97 --> 2:02:27.33
That little fella, he could have walked into a big hole or got eaten by a crock.

1460
2:02:27.37 --> 2:02:30.84
- What if the cops have got him? - Don't you bloody start. He's an Aboriginal boy!

1461
2:02:30.88 --> 2:02:36.29
Wait. You're just hiding behind that blackfella business so you don't get hurt.

1462
2:02:36.35 --> 2:02:38.84
This isn't about walkabout, is it?

1463
2:02:38.88 --> 2:02:42.35
Is it? You're running.

1464
2:02:43.52 --> 2:02:45.95
- I'm not running, mate. - Yes, you are, brother.

1465
2:02:47.99 --> 2:02:51.48
You're scared of getting your heart hurt like before, when my sister died.

1466
2:02:54.77 --> 2:02:57.92
But knowing you, you probably never told Mrs. Boss that you loved her, eh?

1467
2:03:00.04 --> 2:03:03.13
You got no love in your heart...

1468
2:03:03.17 --> 2:03:05.19
you got nothing.

1469
2:03:08.81 --> 2:03:11.81
No dreaming, no story.

1470
2:03:12.85 --> 2:03:14.84
Nothing.

1471
2:03:25.30 --> 2:03:27.72
Hey. Big mob of army fellas.

1472
2:03:30.40 --> 2:03:32.89
Must be diggers, eh?

1473
2:03:32.94 --> 2:03:35.90
They're not diggers, mate. They're Yanks.

1474
2:03:35.94 --> 2:03:38.43
What the bloody hell are they doing here?

1475
2:04:11.74 --> 2:04:13.70
Once you've signed the contract...

1476
2:04:13.74 --> 2:04:17.04
I'll get one of the brothers to take you out to the mission on the sloop.

1477
2:04:17.08 --> 2:04:21.11
You can be happily reunited with your little creamy.

1478
2:04:21.15 --> 2:04:23.74
No loss of pride, Lady Ashley.

1479
2:04:27.83 --> 2:04:30.28
Good morning, Ivan!

1480
2:04:33.23 --> 2:04:37.69
- You look happy. - I am. I get my little boy today.

1481
2:04:37.74 --> 2:04:41.43
Oh, and, Ivan, we're leaving the territory tomorrow.

1482
2:04:41.47 --> 2:04:44.74
Good! I need the room.

1483
2:04:44.78 --> 2:04:47.27
I'll miss you too, Ivan!

1484
2:05:19.01 --> 2:05:22.03
- Cath, sorry I'm late. - Quick changeover, girls.

1485
2:05:23.01 --> 2:05:25.40
- Did you speak to Neil? - Yes.

1486
2:05:25.45 --> 2:05:28.07
I'm seeing him about Nullah after my shift.

1487
2:05:28.12 --> 2:05:30.63
- Look. I was just thinking. - What?

1488
2:05:30.69 --> 2:05:33.11
About Nullah.

1489
2:05:33.16 --> 2:05:35.62
What?

1490
2:06:05.16 --> 2:06:07.24
I'm getting a signal from Mission Island.

1491
2:06:07.29 --> 2:06:10.55
Large air formation bearing down. Suspect visibility.

1492
2:06:28.51 --> 2:06:32.25
If you can't understand the ordnance...

1493
2:06:32.28 --> 2:06:34.29
how can you understand the order?

1494
2:06:49.30 --> 2:06:51.72
What's happening?

1495
2:06:58.24 --> 2:07:01.00
We're under attack! We're under attack!

1496
2:07:08.62 --> 2:07:11.01
Hurry up!

1497
2:07:20.13 --> 2:07:21.70
Let them free!

1498
2:08:42.48 --> 2:08:47.63
Drover! Hey! Drover! Magarri!

1499
2:08:47.69 --> 2:08:52.11
Goolaj, where's Mrs. Boss?

1500
2:08:52.16 --> 2:08:55.68
She at that army H.Q. old Carney place!

1501
2:08:55.73 --> 2:08:58.28
Okay. Come on!

1502
2:09:00.03 --> 2:09:02.02
Drover, I'll see you at Faraway Downs!

1503
2:09:05.70 --> 2:09:09.84
You can't go in there, mate!

1504
2:09:14.68 --> 2:09:17.33
- Drover! - Callahan?

1505
2:09:17.38 --> 2:09:19.53
Is she in there? Sarah Ashley.

1506
2:09:19.58 --> 2:09:21.87
- It's too late. - She's in there!

1507
2:09:21.92 --> 2:09:23.93
Hold it, mate!

1508
2:09:25.06 --> 2:09:29.35
Let me in there! Sarah! Sarah!

1509
2:09:29.39 --> 2:09:32.72
Let me in there!

1510
2:09:32.76 --> 2:09:36.03
I'll handle this. You get your man out of here right now!

1511
2:09:36.07 --> 2:09:38.52
- She's a part of dreaming now. - Get out of my way!

1512
2:09:38.57 --> 2:09:40.05
- Go on! Hit me! - Get out of my.

1513
2:09:40.10 --> 2:09:42.83
Go on! Hit me! It's not gonna bring her back.

1514
2:09:42.87 --> 2:09:44.59
She's in there! Sarah!

1515
2:09:44.64 --> 2:09:47.40
Clear the corridor! Come on!

1516
2:09:47.44 --> 2:09:50.74
Nobody past this point unless they're at death's door or already through it.

1517
2:09:50.78 --> 2:09:52.77
You got a name?

1518
2:09:52.82 --> 2:09:55.44
Ashley. Sarah Ashley.

1519
2:09:59.99 --> 2:10:01.94
What did he say?

1520
2:10:40.70 --> 2:10:43.39
But right now it's raining.

1521
2:10:44.64 --> 2:10:48.44
It's different now. We've got Nullah.

1522
2:10:51.04 --> 2:10:53.05
Here you are.

1523
2:11:06.19 --> 2:11:08.44
She deserves a drink like any man.

1524
2:11:10.49 --> 2:11:12.51
- Too bloody right. - Crikey!

1525
2:11:18.57 --> 2:11:21.19
Hey, no boongs in here.

1526
2:11:36.62 --> 2:11:38.63
You didn't say that, did you?

1527
2:11:38.69 --> 2:11:41.27
That's how it is.

1528
2:11:42.56 --> 2:11:44.57
Just because it is...

1529
2:11:46.53 --> 2:11:49.55
doesn't doesn't mean it should be.

1530
2:11:53.17 --> 2:11:55.28
Serve him a fuckin' drink!

1531
2:12:20.73 --> 2:12:23.52
Ah, what does it matter?

1532
2:12:24.94 --> 2:12:26.98
I'm a total bloody ruin.

1533
2:12:27.04 --> 2:12:30.51
I'm evacuating south, like everybody else.

1534
2:12:30.54 --> 2:12:32.72
You're short one glass.

1535
2:12:37.28 --> 2:12:41.19
One... more... glass.

1536
2:12:48.96 --> 2:12:53.06
I leave this place for the looters and the Japs.

1537
2:12:58.44 --> 2:13:00.45
Why not the boongs?

1538
2:13:17.15 --> 2:13:20.35
I saw her this morning...

1539
2:13:20.39 --> 2:13:22.38
before she went to the work.

1540
2:13:22.43 --> 2:13:24.44
She was so happy.

1541
2:13:25.80 --> 2:13:28.62
She was gonna get that...

1542
2:13:28.67 --> 2:13:31.89
little boy and go south.

1543
2:13:33.27 --> 2:13:35.45
What about the children on Mission Island?

1544
2:13:35.51 --> 2:13:40.03
The creamies? They are left out there.

1545
2:13:40.08 --> 2:13:43.97
- They left them out there? - Safe in the hands of God.

1546
2:13:44.01 --> 2:13:46.34
They left them.

1547
2:13:46.38 --> 2:13:49.00
They say the island was hit first.

1548
2:13:49.05 --> 2:13:52.07
They say no one would have survived.

1549
2:13:57.19 --> 2:14:00.02
They say a lot of things.

1550
2:14:02.90 --> 2:14:04.91
There's been some mistake.

1551
2:14:06.00 --> 2:14:08.01
That's Cath Fletcher.

1552
2:14:09.21 --> 2:14:11.29
Oh, God. Cath.

1553
2:14:11.34 --> 2:14:14.71
- Oh, God! - Sort her out.

1554
2:14:14.75 --> 2:14:17.71
- Sarah. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Oh, God!

1555
2:14:17.75 --> 2:14:19.93
Nullah. I've got to get to Nullah.

1556
2:14:19.98 --> 2:14:22.77
- Sarah, the Japs hit the mission first. - No!

1557
2:14:22.82 --> 2:14:25.84
- No! I don't believe you! I don't believe it! - Sarah, look at me.

1558
2:14:25.89 --> 2:14:27.90
No one can get out there.

1559
2:14:32.16 --> 2:14:35.86
No one.

1560
2:14:37.00 --> 2:14:38.95
I need help to get to the island.

1561
2:14:39.00 --> 2:14:42.00
- Half the Jap navy's out there, you stupid bastard. - I have the Lord on my side.

1562
2:14:42.04 --> 2:14:44.62
I don't give a damn who's on your side!

1563
2:14:46.71 --> 2:14:49.40
God works in mysterious ways, Brother. Go, go, go!

1564
2:14:49.45 --> 2:14:51.12
Magarri, secure the boat.

1565
2:14:51.18 --> 2:14:53.57
- Thank you, Lord. Thank you. - Thank you, Bull.

1566
2:15:01.22 --> 2:15:04.59
Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.

1567
2:15:09.20 --> 2:15:12.73
Sarah, we leave at first light.

1568
2:15:32.89 --> 2:15:34.70
Ivan.

1569
2:15:34.76 --> 2:15:38.12
- Check the second dormitory. - Okay.

1570
2:16:15.63 --> 2:16:17.59
Nullah.

1571
2:16:21.94 --> 2:16:23.89
Oh.

1572
2:16:49.67 --> 2:16:51.92
Come on. It's all right.

1573
2:16:53.50 --> 2:16:55.96
- Shh. - Where are the other? Are there other boys?

1574
2:16:56.01 --> 2:16:58.02
- I don't know. - Are there any other boys?

1575
2:16:58.08 --> 2:17:00.59
- I don't know. - Okay.

1576
2:17:00.64 --> 2:17:02.66
Drover?

1577
2:17:04.65 --> 2:17:07.61
- Nullah. - Drover!

1578
2:17:09.72 --> 2:17:12.61
Drover!

1579
2:17:12.66 --> 2:17:15.15
I knew you'd come. I sing you to me.

1580
2:17:15.19 --> 2:17:17.15
Oh.

1581
2:17:20.23 --> 2:17:22.82
- Magarri! - Hey, little fella.

1582
2:17:29.44 --> 2:17:31.83
Mrs. Boss come too?

1583
2:17:31.88 --> 2:17:34.13
Where's Mrs. Boss?

1584
2:17:34.18 --> 2:17:36.19
We, huh...

1585
2:17:36.25 --> 2:17:39.54
We can't say her name anymore, little mate.

1586
2:17:42.85 --> 2:17:45.04
All right?

1587
2:17:45.09 --> 2:17:48.21
Hey. Now you listen to me. I need your help.

1588
2:17:48.26 --> 2:17:50.34
I'm gonna get these fellas off the island.

1589
2:17:50.39 --> 2:17:52.75
You're gonna have to be strong. Can you do that?

1590
2:17:52.80 --> 2:17:54.81
- Mmm. - Good boy.

1591
2:17:56.07 --> 2:17:59.16
All right. Go and get your little mates down there.

1592
2:17:59.20 --> 2:18:01.99
- Come over here. Let's go. - Come with me. It's okay.

1593
2:18:02.04 --> 2:18:05.53
- Come on. - We're gonna get you all off this island, all right?

1594
2:18:05.58 --> 2:18:07.90
All right. Boys, we're gonna have to swim.

1595
2:18:07.94 --> 2:18:11.74
We have to be quiet, like a turtle. Okay?

1596
2:18:11.78 --> 2:18:15.08
Now, I'm gonna take you home on a ship. It's over there. You see it?

1597
2:18:25.40 --> 2:18:27.72
Let's go, boys! Let's go!

1598
2:18:27.76 --> 2:18:29.72
Quick, quick, quick!

1599
2:18:30.73 --> 2:18:32.69
Ivan.

1600
2:18:33.97 --> 2:18:36.49
- Ivan. Swim the big boys down to the sloop. - Right.

1601
2:18:36.54 --> 2:18:39.91
Use the current and drift it down to the end of the wharf. Go.

1602
2:18:39.94 --> 2:18:42.80
Come on, boys. Quick.

1603
2:18:42.85 --> 2:18:45.06
Run! Run!

1604
2:18:45.12 --> 2:18:47.57
Quick, quick!

1605
2:18:47.62 --> 2:18:49.57
Let's go.

1606
2:19:01.20 --> 2:19:03.78
Ah, crikey.

1607
2:19:09.47 --> 2:19:12.56
Hey.

1608
2:19:14.71 --> 2:19:17.30
- I take this mob walkabout. - You'll never make it.

1609
2:19:17.35 --> 2:19:19.33
Well, you gotta make it!

1610
2:19:19.38 --> 2:19:22.10
You got family now.

1611
2:19:22.15 --> 2:19:24.40
You gotta drove this mob home, Drover.

1612
2:19:29.99 --> 2:19:32.58
Good luck, brother.

1613
2:19:35.33 --> 2:19:37.25
- Go, go. - That's it. Good boy.

1614
2:20:17.67 --> 2:20:18.68
Magarri.

1615
2:20:24.01 --> 2:20:26.81
Up the ladder, boys. Quick. Hurry now.

1616
2:20:34.56 --> 2:20:36.20
Come on.

1617
2:21:19.70 --> 2:21:21.71
Drove 'em home, Drover.

1618
2:22:08.55 --> 2:22:10.50
Sergeant, get the men on the trucks.

1619
2:22:10.55 --> 2:22:13.48
We're evacuating within 15 minutes.

1620
2:22:13.52 --> 2:22:17.83
We rendezvous with the main convoy at 0800 hours at Adelaide.

1621
2:22:18.80 --> 2:22:20.91
Start the truck, Sergeant Lapin.

1622
2:22:22.17 --> 2:22:25.29
If anyone is lagging, use whatever force is necessary.

1623
2:22:25.34 --> 2:22:27.89
Every single man, Lapin. And don't take no for an answer.

1624
2:22:27.94 --> 2:22:32.99
- You won't have to wait for us, Captain. - Move! Come on! Move!

1625
2:22:33.04 --> 2:22:36.20
Thanks for coming down, Mr. Fletcher.

1626
2:22:36.25 --> 2:22:38.33
It's my awful duty to inform you...

1627
2:22:38.38 --> 2:22:40.56
that your wife, Catherine.

1628
2:22:42.92 --> 2:22:45.27
My wife is dead?

1629
2:22:45.32 --> 2:22:49.38
It's a funny old world, isn't it?

1630
2:22:49.43 --> 2:22:51.44
Generous to a fault.

1631
2:22:51.49 --> 2:22:55.85
Did you know that Lady Ashley insisted...

1632
2:22:55.90 --> 2:22:57.91
that my wife work her shift...

1633
2:23:00.40 --> 2:23:06.22
so that she could see some... half caste kid on the mission?

1634
2:23:06.28 --> 2:23:08.46
Now my wife's dead.

1635
2:23:10.38 --> 2:23:12.67
Now I've lost everything.

1636
2:23:24.13 --> 2:23:26.21
We have to go, Sarah.

1637
2:23:39.98 --> 2:23:43.61
Come on! Come on, boys!

1638
2:23:45.98 --> 2:23:48.60
They'll be flying in here and blowing us up any minute!

1639
2:23:48.65 --> 2:23:50.73
Get on the bloody trucks!

1640
2:24:08.40 --> 2:24:12.28
Sarah, please. We have to go now.

1641
2:24:19.12 --> 2:24:21.63
My magic not good.

1642
2:24:21.68 --> 2:24:23.64
All the smoke.

1643
2:24:27.86 --> 2:24:32.57
Grandfather.

1644
2:24:54.38 --> 2:24:56.97
Come on, love. Don't muck about.

1645
2:25:05.90 --> 2:25:07.85
Can you hear that?

1646
2:25:09.27 --> 2:25:11.25
Music. Can you hear it?

1647
2:25:11.30 --> 2:25:13.59
Come on, boys.

1648
2:25:20.71 --> 2:25:22.76
Sing.

1649
2:25:26.52 --> 2:25:28.53
- Sarah, please. - Can't you hear it?

1650
2:25:38.26 --> 2:25:40.51
It's children singing.

1651
2:26:03.15 --> 2:26:06.82
- Sarah! What's going on? - Just give her another minute.

1652
2:26:33.45 --> 2:26:35.94
Mrs. Boss! Mrs. Boss!

1653
2:26:37.75 --> 2:26:40.75
Mrs. Boss!

1654
2:26:42.93 --> 2:26:45.85
Mrs. Boss! Mrs. Boss!

1655
2:26:49.13 --> 2:26:51.42
Mrs. Boss! Mrs. Boss!

1656
2:26:57.01 --> 2:26:58.89
Nullah!

1657
2:26:58.94 --> 2:27:01.46
- Mrs. Boss! - Ah!

1658
2:27:01.51 --> 2:27:04.98
- I can say your name! - Oh!

1659
2:27:05.01 --> 2:27:09.11
Mrs. Boss. I sing you to me like the first night I see you.

1660
2:27:09.15 --> 2:27:12.42
Them Japs nearly got us. We had to swim'em.

1661
2:27:12.46 --> 2:27:16.15
Some of them little fellas from the desert can't swim'em.

1662
2:27:16.19 --> 2:27:20.17
But the Drover take 'em on his back like a turtle.

1663
2:27:21.26 --> 2:27:24.63
What did you say? What?

1664
2:27:24.67 --> 2:27:26.62
Drover.

1665
2:27:54.20 --> 2:27:56.99
You're alive! Oh, God!

1666
2:28:26.06 --> 2:28:28.65
Sarah, what's going on? I can't hold the sergeant any longer!

1667
2:28:32.60 --> 2:28:35.73
Come on, boys!

1668
2:28:35.77 --> 2:28:38.79
Oh, my God. It's the children from the mission.

1669
2:28:38.84 --> 2:28:41.37
The last convoy leaves Darwin in a matter of minutes. Come on!

1670
2:28:41.44 --> 2:28:43.40
- In the truck! - Come on, boys!

1671
2:28:43.45 --> 2:28:45.49
- To the truck. Follow Brother Frank. - Truck's waiting. Let's go.

1672
2:28:45.55 --> 2:28:47.29
Follow Brother Frank. Follow Brother Frank.

1673
2:28:47.35 --> 2:28:49.30
- That's it. That's it. - Come on, boys. Come on, boys.

1674
2:28:49.35 --> 2:28:51.64
- Let's go. - Come on, boys.

1675
2:28:51.69 --> 2:28:55.09
Quick as you can to the end of the wharf, and then straight on the truck.

1676
2:28:55.12 --> 2:28:58.09
- Sarah. - Ivan!

1677
2:28:58.13 --> 2:29:00.38
Thank you!

1678
2:29:03.87 --> 2:29:06.32
Thank you.

1679
2:29:06.37 --> 2:29:08.79
I shall prepare your bill.

1680
2:29:13.81 --> 2:29:15.86
Where'd you come from?

1681
2:29:15.91 --> 2:29:19.40
The good Lord has delivered us, but we could do with a ride, Sergeant.

1682
2:29:19.45 --> 2:29:21.84
I'm not Jesus Christ, but I'll give it my best shot.

1683
2:29:21.89 --> 2:29:24.00
Come on, kids. Come on. On the trucks.

1684
2:29:24.06 --> 2:29:26.78
I want a third in the front, a third at the back.

1685
2:29:26.83 --> 2:29:29.76
Come on. Leg 'em up. They're little fellas. Come on.

1686
2:29:29.80 --> 2:29:32.76
Bring those little fellas up to the front.

1687
2:29:32.80 --> 2:29:35.80
You cursed me, you little creamy.

1688
2:29:35.84 --> 2:29:38.96
Oh. Oh.

1689
2:29:41.31 --> 2:29:44.03
When I said that no one could get out there...

1690
2:29:44.08 --> 2:29:46.09
I'd forgotten about you, Drover.

1691
2:29:46.15 --> 2:29:50.12
That no matter. We gonna go back Faraway Downs.

1692
2:29:51.79 --> 2:29:55.08
Yes, he's right. With the water up, it's the safest place in the north.

1693
2:29:56.12 --> 2:29:58.31
These are, after all.

1694
2:29:58.36 --> 2:30:01.73
Extraordinary circumstances.

1695
2:30:03.26 --> 2:30:06.16
Extraordinary circumstances.

1696
2:30:06.20 --> 2:30:08.82
Thank you, Emmett.

1697
2:30:14.74 --> 2:30:17.23
I'll see you mob in Faraway Downs.

1698
2:30:26.05 --> 2:30:29.95
Here, fellas, make some room for the kids, will ya?

1699
2:30:29.99 --> 2:30:32.28

1702
2:30:40.13 --> 2:30:42.65
All right, kids, hold on.

1703

1704
2:30:51.18 --> 2:30:53.19

1708
2:31:04.99 --> 2:31:08.15
Go and tell Callahan!

1710
2:31:21.18 --> 2:31:23.02
Come on, Mrs. Boss. Hurry up.

1711
2:31:36.12 --> 2:31:37.50

1713
2:31:45.60 --> 2:31:47.89

There. That's it.

2:32:26.51 --> 2:32:29.23
No bullet. Me gulapa.

1720
2:33:04.78 --> 2:33:06.73
King George teach me...

1721
2:33:06.78 --> 2:33:10.94
the rain will fall, the grass grow green...

1722
2:33:10.99 --> 2:33:14.68
and life, it begin again.

1723
2:33:20.39 --> 2:33:22.89
Let's go home.

1724
2:33:22.93 --> 2:33:25.01
There's no place like it.

1725
2:34:08.01 --> 2:34:10.73
One thing I know.

1726
2:34:10.78 --> 2:34:14.08
Why we tell story is the most important of all.

1727
2:34:15.75 --> 2:34:18.64
That's how you keep them people belong you...

1728
2:34:18.69 --> 2:34:21.27
always.

1729
2:35:10.60 --> 2:35:12.56
Oh.

1730
2:35:27.66 --> 2:35:31.49
Mrs. Boss, I sing you to me.

1731
2:35:58.52 --> 2:36:00.47
Here.

1732
2:36:57.71 --> 2:37:00.33
And I will hear you.

1733
2:38:06.58 --> 2:38:10.48
âª Sing and I will hear you âª

1734
2:38:10.52 --> 2:38:13.57
âª No matter where you are âª

1735
2:38:14.69 --> 2:38:18.65
âª A song to light the darkest night âª

1736
2:38:18.69 --> 2:38:22.62
âª And guide me from afarâª

1737
2:38:22.66 --> 2:38:25.93
âª And I will neverâª

1738
2:38:25.97 --> 2:38:29.33
âª Be afraid âª

1739
2:38:29.37 --> 2:38:33.20
âª Now I know you're somewhere âª

1740
2:38:33.24 --> 2:38:36.67
âª You're everywhere to me âª

1741
2:38:39.45 --> 2:38:42.10
âª The warming of the sun âª

1742
2:38:42.15 --> 2:38:47.10
âª Upon the earth beneath my feet âª

1743
2:38:47.15 --> 2:38:50.78
âª And when the rain falls down âª

1744
2:38:50.82 --> 2:38:54.85
âª You tell the story âª

1745
2:38:54.90 --> 2:38:59.29
âª And I will hear you âª

1746
2:38:59.33 --> 2:39:02.49
âª Always near you âª

1747
2:39:28.73 --> 2:39:33.34
âª From the sunburnt plains of far off north Australia âª

1748
2:39:34.64 --> 2:39:38.98
âª Came a fella born to ride the wide, brown land âª

1749
2:39:40.44 --> 2:39:43.27
âª Oh, he grew up running wild âª

1750
2:39:43.31 --> 2:39:46.17
âª But soon by all was styled âª

1751
2:39:46.21 --> 2:39:50.52
âª As the country's greatest everdrovin' man âª

1752
2:39:52.09 --> 2:39:56.46
âª Though his legend rode the winds from Broome to Darwin âª

1753
2:39:57.79 --> 2:40:03.18
âª They loved and loathed him right from end to end âª

1754
2:40:03.23 --> 2:40:06.09
âª For when the Drover gave his heart âª

1755
2:40:06.13 --> 2:40:08.89
âª To a girl whose skin was dark âª

1756
2:40:08.94 --> 2:40:14.62
âª From that day on he was no white man's friend âª

1757
2:40:14.68 --> 2:40:17.43
âª So goes the Drover's story âª

1758
2:40:17.48 --> 2:40:20.06
âª You will hear it near and far âª

1759
2:40:20.11 --> 2:40:25.30
âª And in the end it's all he'll ever own âª

1760
2:40:25.35 --> 2:40:28.51
âª It says the outcast is a free man âª

1761
2:40:28.56 --> 2:40:31.24
âª If he sleeps under the stars âª

1762
2:40:31.29 --> 2:40:36.07
âª Makes the blanket of the southern skies his home âª

1763
2:41:09.76 --> 2:41:15.61
âª But the Drover is a man of constant shadows âª

1764
2:41:15.67 --> 2:41:20.82
âª Haunted by his pain his past and name âª

1765
2:41:20.87 --> 2:41:23.96
âª For every mile he rides âª

1766
2:41:24.01 --> 2:41:26.40
âª What he cannot hide âª

1767
2:41:26.45 --> 2:41:28.73
âª Is the longing in his heart âª

1768
2:41:28.78 --> 2:41:31.87
âª To love again âª

1769
2:41:31.92 --> 2:41:34.64
âª So goes the Drover's story âª

1770
2:41:34.69 --> 2:41:37.20
âª You'll hear it near and farâª

1771
2:41:37.26 --> 2:41:42.11
âª And in the end it's all he'll ever own âª

1772
2:41:42.16 --> 2:41:45.56
âª It says the outcast is a free man âª

1773
2:41:45.60 --> 2:41:48.25
âª If he sleeps under the stars âª

1774
2:41:48.30 --> 2:41:53.35
âª Makes the blanket of the southern skies his home âª

1775
2:41:56.54 --> 2:42:01.72
âª And makes the blanket of the southern skies his home âª
